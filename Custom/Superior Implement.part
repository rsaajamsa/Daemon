A rowan wand is polished wood engraved with lightning motifs.

Properties: 
Distant (The range of your area and ranged attack powers increases by 2 when they're used through a distant implement.).
Energized (lightning) (When you use an attack power through an energized implement, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls if the power has the keyword that matches the implement's damage type. The bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and +4 at 21st level.).

Members of other classes gain no benefit from wielding a wand.
Using a wand's power works like using the power normally. To do so, you need to be able to use at least one power from the same power source as the wand.
For example, a rogue who has picked up at least one wizard power through multiclassing feats could use a wizard power in a wand, since each knows one power that uses the arcane power source. Several wands appear below, but you can also design your own.
A wand can contain an encounter power of any class capable of using wands. When you craft a wand, you can choose any encounter power that you know or that is available to your class. You can't choose anything other than a class power (you can't choose a paragon path power, for instance).). </specific>

A cinder wand, in contrast, is blackened and crooked, and warm to the touch.

Properties: 
Empowered Crit (When you score a critical hit with an empowered crit implement, the attack deals 1d10 extra damage. The extra damage increases to 2d10 at 11th level and 3d10 at 21st level.).
Energized (fire) (When you use an attack power through an energized implement, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls if the power has the keyword that matches the implement's damage type. The bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and +4 at 21st level.).

Members of other classes gain no benefit from wielding a wand.
Using a wand's power works like using the power normally. To do so, you need to be able to use at least one power from the same power source as the wand.
For example, a rogue who has picked up at least one wizard power through multiclassing feats could use a wizard power in a wand, since each knows one power that uses the arcane power source. Several wands appear below, but you can also design your own.
A wand can contain an encounter power of any class capable of using wands. When you craft a wand, you can choose any encounter power that you know or that is available to your class. You can't choose anything other than a class power (you can't choose a paragon path power, for instance).). </specific>
