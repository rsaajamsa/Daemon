Description: Cages are made of strong material to confine creatures. A cage has equally spaced bars and a door. Bar spacing can be customized to specific creatures. The typical cage can hold two creatures of its size, a creature one size larger (uncomfortably), or four to six creatures one size smaller. (Creatures more than one size smaller than the cage probably will be able to slip out between the bars.) Cages are normally transported on animals or vehicles. A vehicle such as a wagon can have a cage permanently mounted to it by adding the cage cost to the vehicle cost.

This small fey animate, usually made of wood or cloth, is designed to entertain eladrin children. As with an ordinary puppet, its controller begins moving it by manipulating it with strings. Thereafter, a minor enchantment allows the puppet to continue to move on its own after the puppeteer releases the strings. If the puppet encounters blocking terrain, it randomly turns left or right and continues in the new direction. It does not stop until a creature within 5 squares of it commands it to do so in Elven.

    <specific name="Full Text"> False Path Stones, 1 bag
Category: Gear
Price: 200 gp 
Weight: 2 lb
Description: Devious creatures that want to bait unwitting mortals into entering the Feywild for the first time use these tiny, charmed stones to cruel effect. When a creature takes a few stones from the bag and places them on the ground, a small gravel path springs up that looks like a well-traveled route leading in whatever direction the creature chooses. Once a route has been started, the stones in a bag can be used only for that route, and the rest of them must be laid continually. The path can be up to 5 miles long, provided the creature blazing the trail walks the entire distance, dropping the rest of the stones from time to time along the way. The path lasts for a day before it disappears; the area it described returns to the state it was in before the stones were used, and the stones become like any other ordinary rocks scattered in the wilderness.
	Scouts in the wild use false path stones to create simple roads that make travel easier for those following behind them. </specific>

Description: This thin-bladed saw can cut through tough material, even metal, although doing so can be quite slow. Harder materials dull the blade quickly, so a hacksaw is best used to cut thin or small objects. A single hacksaw blade can cut through a 1-inch-thick piece of iron (or larger objects of softer materials, at the DM's discretion) in up to 2 hours, before  it breaks or its cutting power is exhausted. Each additional blade costs another 5 gp. </specific>

    <specific name="Full Text"> Hurler-Snatcher
Category: Gear
Price: 10 gp 
Weight: 4 lb
Description: With some foraged twine, a supple reed, simple pulleys, and a soft cloth bindle, a kobold can piece together a crude device for getting around obstacles. These hurler-snatchers, as kobolds call them, have long been used to fling objects across gaps safely and retrieve small items lost down narrow chasms.
	Using a hurler-snatcher (4 lb., 10 gp) requires a move action. When you do so, you either transfer one item you have that weighs 5 pounds or less to an unoccupied space or a willing character within 5 squares of you, or you take one similar item that the character or the space has and transfer it to yourself. If you intend to transfer the item to a character, he or she has to have a free hand and must use a free action to catch it. Otherwise, the item lands in that character's space.
	The 5-pound limit on a  hurler-snatcher is enough to carry most simple objects. If items are bundled together in a backpack or a sack, they're usually too heavy to flick around. Some items are too unwieldy to be transferred in this way; your DM ultimately makes the call.
	The hurler-snatcher is constructed to protect what it carries, even glassware, as long as the intended receiver can catch it. Objects break in transit only in a very small number of cases. Kobolds offer no warranties on items sent by way of a hurler-snatcher. </specific>

Description: The concentrated magical substance that results from performing the Disenchant Magic Item ritual, residuum can be used as a component for any ritual. You can't usually buy it on the open market; you acquire it by draining it out of magic items.

Components are needed by ritual casters. You purchase as many gold pieces worth of components as you need or can afford. You can use the components associated with a key skill for any ritual that uses that skill. Ritual components are not interchangeable; you can't use alchemical reagents to perform a ritual requiring sanctified incense, for example. But you can use residuum for any ritual.

You can buy ritual components at some shops, your allies can provide them (sharing the cost of a ritual with you), or you might find them as treasure. However you acquire components, record their value on your character sheet. When you perform a ritual, mark off the ritual's cost from the appropriate components. </specific>
