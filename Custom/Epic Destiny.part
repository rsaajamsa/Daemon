It is your destiny to stand against the encroaching darkness that threatens to overwhelm the world. You started with battles against goblins and kobolds, but as time passed and your skill grew you faced ever more dangerous foes. Now, you understand that your fate rests far beyond the borders of the lands you have defended. Great powers from other planes threaten the world, and it is up to you to endure their attacks and end their menace forever.
	As an Indomitable Champion, you are almost impossible to sway from your quest. Drawing on reserves of vitality, energy, and vigor, you push on despite your enemies' efforts. Destiny has chosen you to achieve some great deed, and as an epic hero you soldier on despite the obstacles and foes you face.

The world has seen many empires, but all of them have fallen to treachery from within and enemies from without. You realize that if the world is ever to be safeguarded against evil, the old empires must arise again. It is your destiny to defeat the cosmic forces—be they deities, demon lords, or archdevils—that conspire to crush civilization.
As a Destined Scion, you take the fight to the enemies of the mortal world. In battle, you are stern and resolute. Your foes' attacks cannot stop you, and when the time comes to deliver a killing blow, your attack strikes true.

When you follow this destiny, you begin to transform into an avatar of your dead deity, but at a price. As you leech power from your deity, your soul slowly dwindles and rekindles glimmers of the deity's consciousness. You gain considerable power and mental resilience but sacrifice some of your life force to earn that power.
	As this connection grows stronger, you also become more attuned to the lingering echoes of your deity's feelings and thoughts. You come as close to being one entity as is possible, and this brings the realization that you must surrender your individuality to ever bring your power to the next level and achieve the return of your deity—or, if you prefer, your transformation into a deity.

Your ceaseless drive to learn and your devotion to Ioun has enabled you to attain a status few others can claim. As a Sage of the Swan Tower, you have gained access to the glorious Halls of Enlightenment and can call upon its infinite knowledge. You, however, are not like the other sages. You find the traditional method of learning through reading to be insufficient and spend much of your time in the field, acquiring new knowledge and testing theories.
    Each new nugget of information—each new revelation—brings you closer to the goal that you have held in your heart for so long. You feel the call of Ioun as you achieve greater feats of discovery and demystify new layers of knowledge. Eventually your dream becomes reality, and you are invited to become one of the timeless sages of the Swan Tower.
    Life among your fellow sages in Kerith-Ald is all you hoped it would be, yet you see more potential for yourself every time you visit the Pillars of Ioun. It has been a long time since Ioun has honored one of her sages in such a way. Perhaps with some perseverance you can come to deserve your own alabaster monument.

As a Guardian of the Void, your destiny is tied to those who hope to unlock the power of the Echoing Void. Perhaps you crossed paths early, fighting a minor skirmish that later proved to be one of the first steps in beginning the ritual. A guardian has little knowledge of this destiny, assuming its mantle only when the ritual nears its final stages. You might find that a few disparate events come together to paint a terrifying pattern—one that you must disrupt.
	A Guardian of the Void fights to prevent the Echoing Void's completion, to destroy all knowledge of the ritual, and to defeat those who would pursue the power it offers. By the time a guardian arises, the threat posed to the cosmos is both dire and imminent. You will face down the servants of the powerful creature that seeks to complete the Echoing Void, preparing for your final battle. </specific>

The Shadowfell is a realm of death, the one thing in the universe that unifies all mortal folk, from the lowliest beggar to the mightiest emperor. Even the gods are vulnerable to death's sting. During the Dawn War between the gods and the primordials, many deities fell in battle. Since that time, gods have died at the hands of demons and even mortals.
	Some creatures seek to escape death's grasp. A wizard walks the dark path of lichdom to attain immortality. An alchemist brews a secret elixir that will extend his life by centuries. Such creatures only delay the inevitable. Others, however, take a more direct approach to avoiding their fate.
	Scattered pieces of lore, some dating back to the time before the Dawn War, suggest that death is not an intrinsic part of the cosmic order. By performing a dark ritual known as the Echoing Void, creatures intent on immortality at any cost can overcome death—but only by sacrificing millions of sentient lives.
	The signs of preparation for this ritual are unmistakable. For a creature that seeks to create devastation on such a massive scale, the options are few—perhaps smashing an astral dominion or annihilating an entire region of the world. Secrecy rather than overwhelming power is such a villain's primary tool, since the pursuit of the Echoing Void is bound to draw the wrath of heroes, gods, fiends, and primordials alike.
	When the ritual of the Echoing Void is begun, the magic it gathers spawns an equal and opposite reaction. The cosmos anoints champions to oppose the ritual's master. These powerful heroes become the Guardians of the Void, dedicated to preventing the wholesale destruction of the established order of death and life.

A constant stream of spirits passes through the Shadowfell—part of a grand procession of life, death, and rebirth known to a few ascetics as the everflow. Those who believe in the everflow also believe that it was once intended to return souls back to the world for a new lease on life. According to legend, the dread god Nerull usurped the everflow by hoarding the spirits of the dead. His successor, the Raven Queen, only partly undid the damage done by the fallen god, cutting the everflow short and passing judgment on mortal souls as she sees fit.
	The select few who have glimpsed this truth have chosen to correct the course of the everflow. To do this, the Keepers of the Everflow must find a mighty construct hidden deep in the darklands of the Shadowfell—the great Spirit Wheel, set in motion by the actions of the first Keepers. If they complete their work, the everflow will trickle away from the Raven Queen's domain as the procession of souls is redirected from the road to Letherna back into the world. The existence of the Keepers of the Everflow is an affront to the god of death, and she will stop at nothing until the faithful of this upstart order are all held in her wintry grasp.

	Of all the dangers to Letherna, none rank higher than Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath.

Letherna lies deep in the Shadowfell, far beyond the reach of most mortals. This bastion of the Raven Queen is seen only by the spirits of the dead and by the privileged retainers and bodyguards of the god of death. Those loyal to the Raven Queen stand ready to defend her citadel's frost-covered walls from any threat.
	Ages ago, when the Raven Queen struck down the dread god Nerull, the other deities crafted a pact that changed the nature of the gods' relationship with death. To prevent the recently ascended queen from hoarding the spirits of the dead as her own personal army, the pact stipulated that the Raven Queen would be the god of death but not god of the dead, serving as a custodian of the natural cycle of life and death. In return, the gods would allow the Raven Queen to enlist their own followers to aid her worshipers in the defense of her realm. This arrangement suited the Raven Queen, herself an ascended mortal, who preferred to deal with mortals more than with the uncaring powers of the Astral Sea.
	That call of duty has sounded again. The armies of Letherna have need of commanders, and only the greatest heroes can be entrusted with the sanctity of the afterlife. With grim determination, the Marshals of Letherna pick up the Raven Queen's banner and stand fast in the defense of her bastion.

All mortals have a dark road ahead of them in the afterlife. When their spirits are released from the flesh they were born into, they venture into the Shadowfell to make their way to the cold slopes of Letherna—and to whatever final destination awaits beyond the halls of the Raven Queen. However, some souls linger in the mortal realm, unable or unwilling to take this fateful journey. Entities such as ghosts, specters, wraiths, and devourers are the most dangerous of these hesitant spirits, committing atrocities through malicious intent or mindless despair.
	In response to this scourge, the greatest and wisest heroes of the world are called by fate and the Raven Queen to serve as the Twilight Tribunes. These selfless champions dedicate their lives to seeking out and destroying wayward incorporeal souls. By invoking their dread judgment, the Twilight Tribunes allow even the most tormented undead to leave their lives and pain behind. As they follow the path of their destiny, the Twilight Tribunes are drawn to ever more powerful creatures and challenges, working their way through the most fearsome creatures of shadow and undeath. Having dispensed with liches, dracoliches, and vampires, a tribune might be called on in the end to face off against beings of godlike power and the greatest lords of the undead.

Few heroes have borne the name Witch Queen (or Witch King), but those few have inspired awe, fear, and dread.
	These beings become living legends, the stock character in the myths, fairy tales, and horror stories of every race, as awe-inspiring as they are terrifying. Those who have accepted this mantle have learned to incorporate their power into their being, no longer treating it as a source separate from their form.
	Before becoming a Witch Queen, those who aspired to fill the role were conflicted between three aspects: one's power, one's familiar, and one's self. But when one becomes a king or queen of all witches, these aspects merge, allowing a Witch Queen or Witch King to bring forth spells as easily as if his or her familiar had whispered the arcane words directly into their ear. These individuals are near equals to their patrons in power, and armies clamor to their banners, while mortals and immortals alike seek their counsel to beg their favor or plead for their mercy.

Deep in the Feywild, far from the stately halls of the eladrin, a tradition has been upheld for eons. In shadowy forests thick with moss and undergrowth, the baying of hunting hounds sounds, followed by the long strides of their masters. As storm clouds cover the sky, the forest is no longer a realm of bedtime stories or folk tales. It becomes the province of the Wild Hunt.
	The tradition of the Wild Hunt originated among the firbolgs, fey giants devoted to the moon and the Three Fates, personified by Sehanine (the Maiden), Melora (the Mother), and the Raven Queen (the Crone). The firbolgs call for a Wild Hunt when they seek to punish an oath breaker, for oaths are powerful things in the Feywild. Some mortals, their trust betrayed by the Unseelie fey, have learned to summon these eldritch hunters to bring down those who wronged them. A select few learn the ritual for summoning the hunters, but instead of asking for justice, request to learn the secrets of the Wild Hunt.

You have become a legend among legends, and your anointment as a Shiradi Champion echoes throughout the world. Your name is used in bedtime stories and folk tales as a synonym for chivalry and courage. Fey seek you out, asking for your help. Mortals call your name out at fey crossings, seeking your might against enemies equally legendary. It is your burden to help them, thus spreading the influence of the Court of Stars.
	Your greatest task is the defense of the Court of Stars from those who would see it torn asunder. You and your allies stand against cyclops warlords, mad fomorian kings, and dreadful hags, beating back their advances and recovering the lands lost during centuries of battle. In time, you might even receive a request for aid from the Queen of Summer to face down her own son, the Prince of Frost, mightiest of the Winter Fey. You strive to be ready for the task.
	As a Shiradi Champion, you are the ultimate defender of all the good things represented by the Court of Stars. Your powers reflect the ephemeral and radiant nature of the Feywild's rulers. </specific>

Myriad archfey band together several times a year at the congress known as the Court of Stars, where they engage in diplomacy, schemes, marriages, betrayals, and legendary revels. Although dozens of lesser factions make up the Court of Stars, they mostly acknowledge the leadership of Her Summer Majesty, Queen Tiandra. And the Queen of Summer, when the need arises, turns to her anointed warriors for the defense of her subjects and allies. These warriors are known as Shiradi Champions, the shields of the fey.
	Whereas eladrin nobles might rise through the ranks of coures, bralanis, ghaeles, and other complex titles, Shiradi Champions are usually individuals who have earned the respect and trust of Queen Tiandra. Archfey of all courts assemble at Senaliesse to bear witness to a champion's anointing. Some eye these protectors with suspicion, arrogance, or envy, but their pettiness is ill placed. Each Shiradi Champion is devoted to the lovely Queen of Summer and determined to justify her trust.
	Some eladrin Shiradi Champions are also shiere knights (see Player's Handbook 2). A very few champions are not born as one of the fey, and their ascendancy to the role of Shiradi Champion is an unprecedented event, a testament to the champion's unique valor and great worth. Whatever path a champion takes, he or she is assuredly an ally and protector of good-natured fey beings everywhere.

During their imprisonment, the primordials have never ceased their efforts to escape and to resume the struggle against the gods they hate.

Long ago, an ancient race of mighty sorcerers abandoned the material world for the Elemental Chaos, drawn by the plane's infinite mutability. These were the Reigar, a humanlike people who revered personal freedom, expression, and artistry above all other values. In time they mastered the secrets of immortality and became a race of godlings in mortal form-self-centered, capricious, driven only by the desire to experience new sensations and outdo each other in creative works. Foreseeing that their race would eventually dwindle and stagnate, the Reigar created one last masterwork of cooperative magic: a sentient, self-guiding force that would seek out the most brilliant and worthy souls among mortals and gift them with the powers of the Reigar, thus renewing the race across the ages.
	In the course of your mortal adventures, you have developed into that one person in a million who embodies the exquisitely rare mix of brilliance, beauty, willfulness, and creativity that characterizes the immortal ranks of the Reigar. The ancient lore of the Reigar has revealed itself to you and given you the ability to shape the world to suit your whims.

And as those who look to you for leadership multiply, the whispers begin that you are more than human. Not only are you set apart from mortals, but your destiny is to ascend even further, beyond the petty concerns of the material world. This ascension will mark not only your own greatness, but also that of the civilization you champion.
	At first you remain a physical presence in the capital of your realm, guiding your governors and generals with a firm hand, but over time your laws and commandments take on their own life.

Thus you germinate the seeds that will become a new reality born from your mortal achievements.

Your fate is to peer through the veil of worlds and see reality as it truly is, to behold the wonder and splendor of creation and mold it in whatever way you desire. You have always sensed the inherent possibility in your surroundings, always sensed the energy that wells up from rocks and trees, wind and rain. At one time, you thought such power belonged to the spirit world. The more you studied, the more you realized that the spirits are only one part of a much grander story that began when the primordials merged form with substance. 
	This realization has helped you to harness the latent energy in all things, to call it forth, and to use it as you will. You realize that such knowledge is dangerous: Its reckless exploitation could complete the task the primordials began so long ago—that of unraveling the fabric of creation. It falls to you to husband your knowledge, to keep it safe and carry it with you until the end of your days.
	As a Master Hierophant, you have perfected the blending of elemental and primal magic. One feeds into the other, and their fusion energizes a great cycle through which you can transcend your mortality and become something greater. Fire and wind, earth and water are yours to command. They serve you as you carve your name in history. As you progress up the ladder of knowledge, exposure to elemental power slowly changes you; your mortality is stripped away until you become something akin to the primordials of old.

Through self-training or extensive study, you have learned to control psionic energy and wield it in a responsible and careful fashion. As you mastered your art, you realized that many are reckless with their talents. Like arcane magic, psionic power harbors the potential to unleash incalculable destruction. To avert catastrophe, you realized that any who dabble in these mysterious techniques must be watched, guided, and taught to control their talents. 	Your revelation and growing power attracted the Order, an ancient society of psionic adepts who stand apart from the land's struggles. The Order is concerned only with maintaining balance among those who wield psionic power. As a member of the Order, you have dedicated your life to ensuring that those who wield psionic magic use their power responsibly and with restraint.

Your destiny is fulfilled as the sorcerer-kings fall. The natural forces grow strong once again, and the tyranny of defiling and slavery crumbles. You have lived up to your purpose as a beacon of hope and a sworn enemy of Athas's dark rulers.
	Peace-Bringer: You contributed to the fall of the sorcerer-kings-a triumph that will allow the world to slowly renew itself. Now, your task is to serve as a caretaker for the world as it returns to its past glory. You plant the seeds and tend the shoots that will someday spread to cover Tyr and the lands beyond. While you watch over the burgeoning groves of Athas, you also keep an eye on the new civilizations that spring up from the wreckage of the city-states.

The ancient, long-lived pyreens embody all life on Athas. In their features are the traits of every race. Many of them share ancestry with the primal spirits. From your early years, you felt a kinship with these rare and elusive creatures. As time went on, and your primal power grew, you became one of them.
	As a powerful primal protector, you guard a vast region of land. The Forest Ridge or the Estuary of the Forked Tongue might be under your personal protection. The spirits of the land listen to your counsel and regard you as one of them. They exalt you, because you have the ability to restore the world to verdant glory.
	As a pyreen, you can never die from old age. This quality gives you a perspective others lack: The things worth fighting for in the world are those that last. Though you might assist people in fixing what you regard as trivial plights, you rarely put your life in jeopardy for their sakes. You know that a much greater destiny awaits you.

Constant pressure causes the Far Realm's corrupting influence to leak through even the smallest breaches into the natural world, spawning horrors that tear at the fabric of existence. These breaches represent some of the greatest dangers to the mortal realm, and generations of heroes have dedicated themselves to maintaining the integrity of the Far Realm's boundaries. Over a lifetime's adventuring, however, you have grown weary of this ultimately doomed effort.	For each fissure that is closed, two more open elsewhere. Worse, how many of the fault lines riddling creation remain undetected? The Far Realm relentlessly seeks to corrupt the mortal realm, but whereas most heroes seek only to defend against the Outside's malign influence, you have a better idea. You will turn the tide on the Far Realm by assaulting its borders, its creatures, its very nature. And if you cannot reshape the Far Realm with the benign influence of the natural world, you will destroy it utterly to eliminate the threat it represents.

Then, as the warm winds chase away snow and ice, new life begins. With the spring comes the chance to clear away the detritus and weeds of each life that has passed before.

Most dragonmarked individuals manifest their marks in adolescence, when heirs of the dragonmarked houses undergo a rite called the Test of Siberys. This test puts the young heirs into stressful situations in the hopes that their marks will manifest. Siberys dragonmarks, however, break all the rules.
	The magic of a Siberys dragonmark is powerful and fundamentally unpredictable. The mark is larger and more elaborate than the normal mark in its family, but it's rare for a normal mark to develop into a Siberys mark—more often, Siberys marks appear on older members of the house who were previously unmarked. Even more so than the common dragonmarks, a Siberys mark is viewed as the touch of the Prophecy—a character's inextricable link to the destiny of the world.
	The dragonmarked houses keep a careful eye on members who bear Siberys marks. If a Siberys mark can be used in the service of the house, the house's leaders are content to let it, but a Siberys heir who does not remain firmly under the house's control is likely to become the target of assassins.
	In game terms, a character can adopt the Heir of Siberys epic destiny to reflect the presence of this exceptional mark. Most characters with Siberys dragonmarks did not previously have a dragonmark, but a character who already has a dragonmarked feat isn't prevented from taking this paragon path.
	This is a generic destiny that any Heir of Siberys can choose, though the utility power the destiny bestows at 26th level depends on the character's specific Siberys dragonmark. You can also craft unique epic destinies for each Siberys mark or even for each individual with such a mark. Heirs of Siberys, by their nature, defy easy categorization and have little in common with each other or with other dragonmarked characters.

When you close your eyes and put yourself to rest, visions of an ancient battle rise unbidden to the front of your mind. Wave after wave of your enemies rush toward you. Your allies have already fled, making their way to safety. You volunteered to stay behind, to act as the stopper in the bottle that would keep your enemies from rushing through to their objective. You stood alone, in the face of overwhelming defeat, and yet death did not claim you right away. As the ground became slick with the blood of your enemies, you held their forces at bay. Your allies escaped, and you perished only once their safety was assured.
	That was long ago, in another life. The memories of that fateful day, the day in a past life in which you died so that your allies might live, have only begun to return to you as you became powerful enough to embrace such a fate. That day you became a legend, and now you know that you have been reincarnated so that you can once again lay your life on the line to defend your allies. You are the shield that stands between your enemies and those you would protect, and just as you once held many legions at bay, so too will you again let your enemies smash themselves upon you like waves on the rocks.
	As you have grown in strength and prowess, the visions of that ancient battle, and others like it fought across many lives, have slowly come into focus. With every step forward, you remember more details and see those memories with more clarity until you can recall each heroic death in crystal-clear detail. By the time you learn the nature of your Destiny Quest, you have reclaimed memories of dozens of battles, spread across as many centuries, where you acted as the final bulwark against your enemies' assaults. Now, you begin to reclaim many lives' worth of experiences as your own, building upon the knowledge you gained in countless battles against overwhelming odds, once again preparing yourself for the final battle where you might stand alone once more against legions of foes.

As you grow ever more enlightened about the thievery and trickery that you had mastered in your past life, reality once again begins to bend around you, allowing you to steal things that others say can never be taken.
The Greatest Prize: Despite the fact that your skills can be used for greed and self-service, you have been spun back into the world for some purpose. You have one great thing that you must steal—one bit of thievery for which you were given a new life and incarnation. This prize is the subject of your Destiny Quest; you might be destined to steal the magic away from an ancient dracolich or to place your hands on the only artifact that can slay the dark goddess Lolth. Once you steal the object of your Destiny Quest, you have fulfilled your role in the world. Only then can you once again have the power to take what lies beyond the grasp of all mortals, as you finally recall the full extent of the techniques that allow you to filch the intangible. </specific>

Long ago, there lived a thief who was so skilled at the art of taking that nothing was outside his grasp. Some said that he could steal the throne out from underneath a king, make off with the princess's smile, and snatch the stars from the night sky—all over the course of a single evening! How much of the thief 's myth was true and how much has become the tall tales of legend is a matter of debate, but few take such stories seriously. Such tales border on the ridiculous for most people, but you know the truth: The legends are real, and you are that Thief of Legend reborn.
	The Thief of Legend could do all of the fantastic things that people today describe. This thief had fingers so light and nimble that some said he could steal the crown off the queen without her even noticing. His movements were so quiet that death could not track him. His plans were so cunning that he outwitted the gods at every turn. Artifacts guarded by thousands of angels vanished from Astral domains, and the only evidence that remained of the thief 's passing were the faint echoes of laughter where treasures once were held.
	Yet these feats have, on occasion, been reproduced by other mortals. The true point of transition between master thief and Thief of Legend came when this thief learned how to steal things that are intangible. So great was this legendary thief 's skill that reality bent to his trickery. He discovered ways to steal laughter, or memories, or the color from a painting. Now, generations later, that thief has been reborn, and you are coming to realize that you are the reincarnation of this famous thief. Over time, you have begun to recall the tricks and techniques that you mastered in that former life, and you are growing once more into the master thief that the stories still describe.

Long ago, far back in the mists of time, ancient dragons mastered the power of arcane magic and used it to shape the world around them. In those dark first days, the world was a primeval place, and these dragons held dominion over everything they beheld. The races thought of as ancient today, such as dwarves and elves, were but children when these spellcasting dragons were at the height of their power. The fabric of reality was reshaped by these dragons, who used their arcane prowess to warp the world around them.
	Those days of limitless power could not last, and soon the mighty dragon sorcerers fell. Being jealous guardians of their arcane lore, few passed on what they had learned to the other dragons. Over time, as these dragons fell into obscurity and legend, the knowledge of their spells and magic likewise vanished from the world. Now, millennia later, archmages and sages occasionally unearth fragments of lore pertaining to these great wyrms and perhaps master a spell or two from the dragons' repertoire. Even the most powerful wizard, however, would be but a stage magician compared to the ancient spellcasting dragons.
	Now the winds of fate circle around once more, and the spirits of those long-dead dragons find themselves spun back into the world, this time in the bodies of smaller, mortal creatures. Although others might feel the call of arcane magic from the depths of their soul, you hear the whispers of the ancient dragon spirit within you. It coaxes you, guides you, and teaches you. Yours is not a quiet soul but a raging inferno of arcane knowledge waiting to be released. Your dragon soul awakens and remembers what it was like to be a master of all it saw.

You failed to protect someone in your care. It might have been a friend, a family member, or a former member of your adventuring party, but you feel responsible for that loss. In return, you've rededicated yourself to the ideal of the defender—a protector of friends and a fierce obstacle to foes—but with a specific focus. All enemies will learn that the only way to defeat your allies is by going through you first, and your abilities lend you an alacrity many cannot match.

To succeed at being the first line of defense, you have trained to take advantage of every opening that your enemies leave you as quickly as possible. To those around you, you move twice as fast as any other defender to blunt your foes' attacks. You see it as a natural progression that anyone of enough skill could attain, though your desire to not see anyone else lost drives you beyond the point of mere humans.

As you grow in skill, your ability to react to enemies quickly continues to grow. An attempted ambush turns into a disaster for your foes as you move in before they are ready. When you reach the apex of your power, your oath to never allow an ally to fall before you can finally be fulfilled. You can channelyour strength into those whom you have sworn to protect, keeping them standing long after your enemies would otherwise have overwhelmed them.

Immortal World Walker: As you draw closer to the completion of your Destiny Quest, more and more memories begin to flood your mind from lives both recent and ancient. As the memories threaten to overwhelm your own personality, you learn to harness their knowledge and perform miracles that you would not have normally thought you could achieve.

When you have embraced your destiny, you fully merge with the memories of your past lives; no longer do they surface from time to time, but you call upon them at will, as though you had experienced all they had to offer in this lifetime. You transcend who you are, becoming, instead, an amalgamation of everyone you have ever been. This transformation permeates every fiber of your being, including your physical form, and you cease to be troubled by mortal concerns such as aging or a natural death.

The soul of a deva is reborn each time it dies, leaving the deva with relatively fresh memories from past lifetimes. However, some spirits are reincarnated over and over again throughout the centuries, each as different races and with different professions. When one of these reincarnating spirits is reborn as a deva, it creates an unusual situation where the deva can recall past lives beyond those recalled by most devas.

You are one of these few who can cast their thoughts far back in time, calling upon memories of lives as humans, elves, dwarves, and other races. You might have memories of life as a dragonborn warrior defending the walls of an Arkhosian fortress, and maybe you recall the First Days when you and your fellow elves first walked the forests of the world. You remember being among the dwarf crafters as you laid the foundation for the first buildings in Hammerfast, and the taste of bitter betrayal as you stood with your fellow tieflings in the ashes of Bael Turath.

You have an uncanny sense of time unlike that possessed by your fellow devas. Also, unlike other devas, you cannot say for certain that you will be reborn again with the knowledge of your past lives, and you must seize this rare chance to make use of the memories you possess. With knowledge of the world from the dawn of time, you have a chance to see the greater picture and gain the kind of scope you need to make history-altering changes that frequently remain only within the domain of gods.

You live half in the present, and half in the future as a disincarnated spirit. As the present catches up to the future, you draw closer to the fate that you have forged.

Destined Rebirth: In the days, weeks, and months leading up to the completion of your Destiny Quest, you wield powers that are supposed to be possessed only by devas in their spiritual state. As you do so, you steer yourself toward your own eventual rebirth, either by using those powers for good deeds, or for wicked.

When you have at last achieved that which you were destined to do, you know that you can finally shed your current form and move on to the afterlife you have forged. As all devas do, you relieve your spirit of your body, but unlike other devas you spend no time in a state of bodiless dreaming between lives. Each time you die, you are reborn instantly in the form that you chose (either as a deva, or as a rakshasa), full of the knowledge that you gained during your last life. Each time you die, the wheel of fate spins you out into the world, in a form chosen by you, and with the ability to wield the powers that bestow the miraculous reincarnation upon your race. </specific>

Death holds few mysteries for the devas, who know—for a fact—that a new life waits for them beyond death. However, uncertainty comes in the form of the question of whether the deva is reborn as a deva, or as a rakshasa, depending on the wickedness of the deva's life. Many devas believe that being affected by curses or dying particularly vile deaths can corrupt their souls, transforming the most benevolent deva into a rakshasa in his or her next life.

You, however, have broken through the barriers of knowledge to peer into the future of your disincarnation, the time when you become a bodiless entity drifting through the spirit realm. You know that death is soon to be upon you, but not before you have attained your destiny. You have already mastered the power bestowed upon your soul as a disincarnate, and you can wield those powers while you yet live. For you, disincarnation holds no uncertainty, because you know that you can forge your next life with your actions in this one.

Having already tapped into the same mystical power that bestows constant rebirth upon your soul, you can call upon abilities granted only to disincarnated deva spirits and rakshasas, becoming more than who you are and, instead, becoming a manifestation of who you might yet be. You have reached into the mystical afterlife waiting for all devas and drawn back a fragment of the power that makes such miracles possible. You see not just your own future, but many possible futures, and you can alter the winds of fortune to guarantee the reincarnation you seek.

You were always talented with a blade, but you learned early on that a dozen blades raised as one could defeat the mightiest lone warrior. Combining many individual efforts into one force is a daunting challenge, one surpassed only by the hazards of battle itself.

As a War Master, you seek to forge order from the chaos of battle. Under your command, your allies fight with unmatched coordination and skill. Your tactical skill and insight make you a daunting foe. Under your command, even a mob of ill-armed peasants is a daunting fighting force.

With each victory, you set your sights ever higher. As you grow in power, you seek to prove that no horde or army the cosmos can muster can best you and your forces on the field of battle.

For you, the divine runes were never merely inert symbols that channeled divine magic. Instead, the runes have always been more like living creatures to you. You don't simply mark a rune on stone or paper or trace it in the air. You breathe life into it, carefully forming its curves and lines while drawing divine magic into it.

Your deep understanding of the runes and the power they represent marks you as one of the greatest runepriests ever. As you enter the final stage of your career, your understanding of your art grows still deeper. At first in small, tantalizing hints and later in insights that come upon you like bolts from the heavens, you understand the fundamental structures of the runes. You are no longer content to learn of the runes created by the gods. Your ambition and mastery push you to create new runes, to find the markings that catalog, and perhaps even create, entirely new aspects of the world.

Should you prove worthy of this task, the very fiber of the cosmos might bend and shift at your command. The power you seek is far greater than any you previously imagined you could control, but with diligence, bravery, and faith, you know that you can achieve anything. Soon you will take your place beside the gods.

When your mortal life is at an end, you will join the spirits in safeguarding the world. In this form, you can hunt forever. </specific>

As a seeker, it falls to you to search out those who would wreck the natural order. The primal spirits forced the gods and the primordials from the world following the Dawn War and still stand as sentinels against their incursions. You understand better than most the chaos and horror that such beings can unleash. Some gods are benevolent, but others are destructive and evil. The gods must attend to their own affairs and allow the mortal world to follow its own fate.

When you took your first steps along the seeker's path, you sought out demons, marauding orcs that burned and destroyed at Gruumsh's behest, and rampant elementals. As these enemies fell before you, your mastery grew. In time, the primal spirits called out to you. There were greater enemies to fight, and you took to the planes to slay them before they could release their horrors upon the world. Titans, aberrations, and other powerful threats fell before you.

Though you have fought and defeated many foes, more and more take their place. You must now seek a new path, one that can help ensure the world's safety forever. As your skills reach their peak, you must seek out the deadliest hunting grounds, planes where the primal might of the world is but a whisper.

You are a Master of the Eternal Hunt. It is your fate to travel far beyond the world to battle those that threaten it. You might die alone and forgotten in some terrible corner of the Abyss, but if you survive, you will join the spirits as an everlasting guardian of all you value.

Your immortality lies not in extending your life beyond its normal limits, but in conquering a foe the world deems unbeatable. Some day, after you defeat a demon lord, an archdevil, or even a god, your victory will echo through history forever.

Unconquered Master: Once you have established that you are the greatest warrior who ever lived, what else is there for you to pursue? Challengers arise, but none can match you. In time, you fade from the world and become a creature of pure psionic magic, content to be the measuring stick for all who come after you.

Across the world and beyond, you have sought the mightiest foes. Giants, dragons, orc kings, demons, and devils have fallen before you. Your skill is unmatched by mortals, and now you turn your attention to the mightiest beings in the cosmos. As you enter the epic tier, you have but one goal: to carve your name in the annals of history as the mightiest warrior of all time.

Many have attempted to travel this road, but few have seen it through to the end. You have searched for their names in ancient tomes. Here and there you find stories of champions who opposed the mightiest beings in the cosmos but died while trying to slay them. By studying their mistakes, you have learned to avoid those errors. When the time comes for you to batter down the gates of Bane's fortress or to cross swords with Asmodeus himself, you will be ready.

Wherever you wander, tales of your deeds spread. Some of those who hear the stories seek you out in hopes of proving their talents by defeating you. Others swear fealty to you, seeing in your crusade the chance for an immortality of their own. You accept both challengers and allies. The former give you the practice you need to hone your skills, while the latter form the army you will one day lead to crush your chosen quarry.

Your life has been a long battle, but now it nears its end. Will you carry the day and achieve undying fame, or will your example serve as a warning to those who travel this path in the future?

You perfect your understanding of the great skein of existence and picture it as a self-reinforcing and self-generating construct of conception and thought. It seems as if all the lesser minds in the universe make up one universal mind, whose perceptions expand once per age. You decide to contribute consciously to that expansion.

Universe Mind: With a smile on your face, you expend all your psionic power in one dramatic flare. Your physical form drops away, a vessel that has served its purpose. You imprint your mind on the universe, becoming an eternal thought, a higher ideal, a meme that will forever reverberate through existence.

Your mind flows like a river during a storm surge, threatening to overflow with a torrent of thought. As your consciousness grows more charged with psionic power, your attention expands each day. Soon, you believe, little will lie beyond your comprehension. No mystery will veil the divide between your desire and reality. You have become the walking embodiment of mind over matter. In truth, your mind controls matter and the perceptions of others. You suspect that you have discovered a new path to divinity, one powered by your will alone. But this is not a divinity that requires the adoration of others; the intensity of your focus is enough to sustain your mounting abilities.

It used to be that an insight would come to you unbidden once in a great while and shine like a star in your mind; a connection you had failed to make before suddenly became clear. Those moments of clarity were wonderful, even more so for their rarity. But now an hour does not go by that you don't make such a startling association. All the components of existence are connected in far more fundamental ways than you had realized.

You now believe that much of what makes up reality is merely the consensus, albeit an unconscious one, of all the thinking beings within it. With your psionic abilities, you can influence how the minds around you see and understand their surroundings, and in so doing, you reshape the world according to your will.

When you first presented yourself to the masters, their amusement at your observations turned to astonishment. Time and again, you were proven right. The masters expected ever more from you as they took you under their tutelage, putting the most daunting tasks and grueling training regimens before you. Again and again, you overcame these challenges.

Others have displayed this same talent, but few have achieved the same level of mastery. You stand on the brink of the final steps of your studies. True, you were the best student in your class, but you know enough of the fighting arts to understand how little you truly know.

Your greatest tests lie ahead of you. Will you finally achieve the ultimate mastery you seek, or will you find that your skills are less than perfect?

You were destined for greatness from your earliest days. As a child, you took to weapons with a natural talent that astonished your tutors. In the early days of your career, your skill, athleticism, and courage surprised everyone. Later, your comrades came to expect nothing less of you than the utmost.

You became aware of a force at work in your life, an inexorable pull drawing you toward the most daunting challenges and the greatest adventures. Even insignificant decisions led you down the path of danger, and against each adversity, you triumphed. In time, you realized that a star in the sky was bound to your fortune.

When you suffer trouble or doubt, your star is dim and low in the sky. When you master your circumstances and defeat your foes, your star ascends and grows brighter. On the occasions when your actions and valor shake the thrones of kings or the pillars of the heavens, your star blazes with a glory marked by sages and astrologers throughout the world. Your star's passage through the constellations of great monsters matches your battles against dire foes, and its journeys into signs of wealth or fortune mark the boons you receive.

	An empire cannot rise overnight, yet many already look to you for leadership. More flock to your banner every day. Your fame surpasses that of any tiefling who has lived since the empire's fall. If the empire can be returned to glory, it will be at your hand.

You will live forever, there can be little doubt of that—or at least, the power of Io that lives in you will survive the death of your mortal form. If you properly fulfill your destiny, though, it will come to full flower in the rebirth of Io, either replacing Bahamut and Tiamat in the pantheon of gods, or making them his exarchs in a new celestial court.

Draconic Apotheosis: When you complete your final quest, you have either reunited enough of Io's scattered power or amassed enough power of your own to restore Io to life. In a dazzling transformation, your body unfolds and expands, like a butterfly emerging from its cramped chrysalis. Enormous wings spread from your back, thick scales cover your hide, and your thundering roar shakes the earth. You have become Io—among the mightiest of gods.

Alternatively, your accumulation of divine power might not transform your own body into the god's form. Instead, you might begin rebuilding Io's ancient astral domain and then reforming his body. Your ultimate destiny, then, is not to become Io himself, but to become his favored exarch, serving at his right hand as a reward for your faithful service in returning him to life. </specific>

When a god dies, its power does not vanish. It can be consumed, often by whatever being was mighty enough to slay it. When Asmodeus killed the god he once served, for example, he claimed that power and made himself divine. When the King of Terror killed Io, the god's sundered body became Bahamut and Tiamat, and those newborn gods claimed Io's power before Erek-Hus could steal it.

However, it is said that a fragment of Io's power remained free, neither absorbed by the new deities nor consumed by the primordial. Perhaps controlled by a shard of Io's mind, the divine power kept itself safely apart, preparing—it is said—for a time when the dragongod would return to life. Some say that one of his loyal angels harbored the fragment of his power, while others claim it was embedded in one of his mortal servants—a dragonborn. (See the Shard of Io background for more ideas.)

Somehow, this shard of divine power has come to rest in you. For now, you are little more than a demigod or an avatar, a distant echo of the dragon-god's full power. The more power you acquire, however, the stronger Io grows. Through you, Io plans to return and reclaim his mantle as the god of all dragonkind.

You won the right to claim your place among the peerless Raven Knights. You don the black garb worn by all in this august order, cladding yourself in the soft velvet robes and wielding the deity's power in her name. In reward for your eternal service, the deity grants you a mighty fortress and lands in the Shadowfell to rule as you wish, warriors to fight beneath your banner, and servants to attend to your every wish. You might be a servant still, but you live as a king. 
Dark Servitor: The deity's favor reveals itself in your flesh even before you earn the title. From the moment you begin your final quest, your body transforms, subtle at the start but profound when you overcome the last obstacle to your prize. Your connections to the natural world weaken as the Shadowfell asserts its influence over you, opening your eyes to new possibilities. Your facial features change, becoming monstrous but strangely alluring for all its bestial aspect. In time, you erase any connections to your former self when you become a sorrowsworn in truth.
By the time you complete your final quest, your old life is a dream compared to the power, prestige, and glory ahead. With your affairs in order, you embark to bring honor and glory to the deity, to join her other trusted servants as her chosen champion. You bear a new burden to protect the deity who entrusted you with such power. How you meet your mistress's enemies and whether you but do with the same loyalty and devotion you did earlier is up to you and your ambition. You might continue as you have or turn your considerable power to reach further than you ever thought possible. </specific>

The Raven Queen's influence across the Shadowfell depends on trusted agents: those sorrowsworn and shadar-kai who make up the esteemed order of the Raven Knights. Charged with protecting the Raven Queen's realm and safeguarding the Shadowfell from those who would pervert its dark power for dread purposes, they move with impunity across the plane, even going so far as to venture into distant worlds where they bring battle to the Raven Queen's myriad enemies. To join this order, you have worked to prove your worth and dedication to the deity and win a place among these guardians. Your fate might be to serve the deity as her chosen champion, but what better destiny could you choose after a life spent fighting in her name?

Still other primal champions reincarnate into new bodies, returning as new exemplars of nature.

You long suspected that you were one of the spirits who regularly return to the world in new bodies, though you could not be certain until the day you attained epic power. As your epic destiny opened before you, so did the memories of your past lives, a long chain of heroes, leaders, humble souls, and conquerors who lived in harmony with the spirits.

You are a champion of the spirit way, a defender of the world's primal cycles. In this life, you finally have the chance to put the knowledge and power of all your incarnations together.

The greatest primal spirits are immortalized in the stories recounted by your people. Told and retold around campfires, these tales warn the young against foolish mistakes and inspire greatness from living heroes. Each telling changes a tale; each speaker alters minor details or fabricates new adventures. These adaptations do not make the tales any less true, however. The primal spirits and their place in the world are fluid, changing with mortal expectation and need.

Although you have learned to count the great primal spirits as allies, you never expected to be included in the stories of the ancestors and elder spirits. Even more disconcerting is that the storytellers incorporate you in the most famous tales, placing you alongside Great Bear and the World Serpent. In these evolving recitations, you play a small part at first, but your role grows with each telling.

If you're a druid, you hear the voices of the ancestors each time you shift shapes. If you're a barbarian, your rages are always tempered by a third perspective, and sometimes a fourth, fifth, and sixth, as if you were observing yourself from above and on each side, seeing through more than your own rage-filled eyes. If you're a warden, you understand that the tribe's ancient protectors are your peers, not just your ancestors. If you're a shaman, you have realized the truth before attaining your epic destiny: The ancestors are more than guides and allies—they were once your comrades, your friends, and your helpers when you walked the world in earlier lifetimes, helping the people as an ancestor spirit.

You are an ancient ancestor reborn into a new life. You share understandings and communication with other primal spirits beyond anything that most primal heroes experience because you know all the voices of the spirits, all the subtle ways and swift whispers by which they make themselves known.

The role of the primal spirits is to protect and preserve the world. Even the World Serpent, whose coils could crush a god and whose fangs could pierce a primordial, exists to protect the natural order and balance of the world, not simply to destroy. Though the motions of the World Serpent's mighty coils can shake the earth, he enfolds the world to shield it from harm, not to crush away its life.

You, though, are a living embodiment of the World Serpent's anger. His venom courses through your veins, and your sinews carry the strength of his coils. You are meant to face some terrible foe—a demon prince or a primordial, perhaps, or even a destructive god who seeks the world's demise. The World Serpent has invested you with his power for a single purpose: to destroy that threat and preserve the world's balance.

You were sent by the Raven Queen to slay a great threat to the cosmos, one that could unravel the very foundation of the planes. Though the Raven Queen is the mistress of death, she is usually content to allow each creature to find its death as its fate decrees. When death and misery spread on too wide a scale against the natural order, to the point when all life is threatened, a Perfect Slayer arises at her command.

As a Perfect Slayer, this might be your first incarnation as a mortal or one of many uncounted iterations. Your prior memories are misty at best, and you have only the barest understanding of the threat you have been dispatched to defeat. Perhaps you knew of the threat from the earliest days you practiced the assassin's art, but you might not have uncovered your quarry's true identity until you attained the heights of your power. You learn of your destiny only when your mistress deems it necessary. Legend holds that some day, the Raven Queen herself shall die on the blade of a Perfect Slayer. Perhaps that is the reason for her secrecy.

Your life has been an endless chase, but now the pursuit nears its end. Will you slay your quarry, or will you die in the attempt?

The divine fragment you carry enables Bahamut to be reborn into the world, to live even if his divine form is slain, as unlikely an event as that might be. If your patron neverfaces destruction, good and constant service undoubtedly rewards you with a place in your god's dominion, perhaps as an exarch, perhaps as something more. Indeed, Bahamut keeps council with the greatest champions to have ever served him, and these allies attend him in all things. 
Bahamut is Dead, Long Live Bahamut: While all gods are immortal, no being is truly unkillable. Should Bahamut die, omens and visions reveal your final quest. Your purpose, to return Bahamut to the world, is made clear. You may carry the divine embryo, but you must take bold steps to allow the godling within to awaken and resume its proper place. When you fulfill every condition, divine fire consumes your very existence to restore the god to corporeal form. The sacrifice required is absolute, its destruction required to facilitate the rebirth. Though you no longer exist, your memory lives on within the god and those who follow him, granting you a rare form of immortality—within the fondest memories of a god. </specific>

Having long championed Bahamut in the world, taking up his causes and making them your own, you garner the god's attention. Seeing in you a reflection of his own noble character, he bestows on you a portion of his divine essence, both to make you a more effective servant and to protect a portion of his divinity against some future calamity. Great power accompanies this grave responsibility, power you can use to resemble your patron and access his own divine qualities.
The holy burden in no way restricts your personal objectives and you are free to pursue your own ends, though your goals likely coincide with those of the Platinum Dragon. You must have special care, however, for the fate of a god—and perhaps more—rests within your imperfect shell. From time to time, Bahamut might call upon you for a special task, to go places where he is unable, and act on his behalf, giving you a look into a possible future where you might serve as his exarch.

Your soul slips through the Raven Queen's fingers—or you've earned her leave. Life and death cease to hold meaning for you. More so than any other creature, your soul is truly your own.

No one can forget your name because you'll always be there. Even the gods and primordials must accept your presence in their creation. Some come to worship you, and while you might not have the power to answer prayers, in one important way you surpass them all: Your resolve might keep you around long after time has worn the gods' names from their tombs.

Yet even as you grow weary of thwarting great powers and accepting accolades, you realize that you can do more with your endless existence. You lived two lives, so why not live ten thousand more? With a change of name and an unfamiliar face, you take up a place in history time and again. And with each glorious life you live, a little of the old warmth of being returns. You're not sure when you'll get tired of it all. Maybe you'll even stick around to see the end. </specific>

You struggled long, and the journey was hard. You've done all they asked and more. And now you're finished. Destiny is a masquerade for other people's plans. No one is going to control your fate—not anymore. Whatever is left of this half-life you lead, you'll live it as you choose.

You're a free agent—a blind spot in the visions of gods and a foil in the plans of everyone else. If they could take you out, they would. Of course, they're always welcome to try. You've done enough killing for two lifetimes, and you'll take them all on again in the afterlife if you have to, assuming you ever get there.

By the favor of the gods, you transcend mortality and join the angelic hosts. Your mortal flesh and blood are transformed into immortal substance; even though you still have your mortal appearance, your spirit shines inside your perfected body like a blazing fire in a crystal vessel. As an angel, you no longer age, and all the infirmities of mortality fall away. In time you learn to assume more and more of the appearance and powers of angels.

You are closely bound to the god who raised you up. You can continue to pursue the quests and goals of your mortal life, but from time to time your deity summons you to specific missions or dispatches you on important errands, and you are expected to answer any such call. Because you were once mortal, you can resume your mortal appearance whenever you wish, hiding your immortal nature. This attribute makes you a valuable servant, since you can go where other angels cannot; exalted angels often serve as spies or advise mortals on important matters without ever revealing their true nature.

The route to immortality is fraught with danger for an avatar of war. Due to a thirst for conflict, an avatar of war engages in many mortal contests. History tells the tale of several avatars of war cut down in epic battles—it could be that your fate is to forge a legend of a hero who only succeeded in dying well. The ultimate challenge lies in giving battle to the gods and primordials. Whether you hope to usurp power from Bane and conquer his home plane of Chernoggar or to rain destruction down upon surviving primordials, you carry in your ambition a war the likes of which hasn't been seen in a thousand years.
Divine Reunion: When your final quest is accomplished and your last foe lies vanquished at your feet, your mortal incarnation ends. Your body falls into gray dust and blows away to the sounds of ravens croaking and tattered banners flapping in the cold wind. Your soul ascends to the astral dominions to rejoin your divine being, bringing with it a lifetime of memories: battles won, battles lost, deeds of courage, acts of cowardice. </specific>

Battle calls you, for you are the god of war. For a mortal lifetime you are incarnated in humanoid shape, sharing the existence and consciousness of a mortal hero. When you speak, you speak for your true divine self. When you act, you act as your godly essence directs. You exist to champion causes worth fighting for, to provide the people of the world with a shining example of valor and skill, and to teach people how to survive in a world filled with darkness and strife.

As an avatar of war, you are probably the incarnation of Bahamut, Kord, Bane, or possibly a dead war deity such as Tuern. However, war is a cosmic force that seems to have its own guiding consciousness, and you might in fact be the incarnation of the principle of war, or an eternal hero reborn to fight in every conflict spawned upon the mortal world.

Life as an adventurer has opened your eyes to the fact that strife and evil are ubiquitous. You have journeyed through many lands, both civilized and wild, and the only constant is the fragility of peace. Others work hard to stop war, but you believe it is the natural state of the world. You recognize that conflict is everywhere, and you embrace it. The machinations of usurpers, tyrants, and warlords will always drive civilization toward violence and destruction— but sometimes it is exactly this destructive force that gives rise to the most powerful and enduring of civilizations.

And after your incarnation ends and you reunite with your immortal being, people will look back on your deeds for centuries to come and see in them the hand of the divine.

As an avatar of storm, you are most likely an incarnation of Kord. However, minor storm deities or dormant powers sometimes incarnate as avatars, so you might be the mortal vessel of some other deity, or even a cosmic principle of storms and destruction.

Thunder and lightning are your weapons, and you wield them with all the fury and wrath of the most violent storm. Wherever you go, storms follow in your wake. You command them and use their power to bring your vengeance upon your enemies.

Lying down in a fair green meadow or forest clearing, you allow your body to crumble into dust, nourishing flowering vines and creepers.

As an avatar of hope, you are an aspect of a god of hope who has chosen to incarnate himself or herself in a mortal body for a time. You now know that you are both your deity and your own mortal shell at the same time. When you speak, when you act, your god speaks and acts through you. No matter what your name, you are a beacon of hope in a dark world.

Sorrow cannot abide your presence; you bring optimism and virtue to places of despair and sadness. You are an enemy of all the gods of evil, for they are destroyers of hope. You hold particular vehemence toward devils and demons—devils for their malicious practices, and demons for their recklessly destructive intentions. It's true that you've seen some terrible sights during your travels—murder, cruelty, slavery, war—but these horrors only fortify your determination. By your power, the points of light that lie within a sea of darkness burn a little brighter for a time.

You are the incarnation of a deity of freedom and liberation. Every word you speak, every action you take, is in exact accordance with your deity's will—because your choices are your deity's choices. In time you will abandon your mortal form and rejoin your eternal essence in the heavenly dominions, but until that time comes you are a champion, teacher, and example for all whom you and your deity hold dear.

As an avatar of freedom, you incarnate your deity's aspects of liberation. You might be Avandra or Melora in mortal form.

Regardless of your divine identity, you believe that the natural state of mortalkind is one free from oppression. You fight any force that seeks the enslavement of others and stand against deities bent on war and domination, such as Asmodeus and Bane. You believe that freedom of choice is the paramount freedom of all mortal creatures, and that destiny is not predetermined. You inspire the downtrodden with words of freedom, and you lead them in attempts to overthrow their vile masters.

You are the mortal incarnation of a deity who holds sway over death. You are not simply Jozan the cleric; you are the Raven Queen, who for a time incarnates in the form of Jozan. Your body is a mere shell, a temporary vessel for the unthinkable might of a deity's soul. You were born to be the Raven Queen's mortal form, and as you grow in understanding and power, the light (or darkness) within you shines out for all to see. You might not have realized your true nature before, but now you know exactly what you are.

As an avatar of death, you incarnate the death aspect of your deity. Most likely this is the Raven Queen, but on rare occasions avatars of dead, dormant, or interloper gods arise—you might be an avatar of the dead god Nerull, or some other death deity contesting the Raven Queen's sway.

Good and evil are just words to you, for death makes all causes meaningless. You stare into the vacant sockets of long-dead kings, gaze across the soul-filled plains of the Shadowfell, and stand upon blood-soaked fields of battle. Through it all, you feel no sorrow, no remorse—only a grim sense of bemusement at mortal foolishness in the face of the inevitable. Adventuring is an amusing way to entertain yourself before life comes to an end.

From the Silver Flame's inception, its purpose in the world has been clear. It was forged from a commitment to stand fast against the growing darkness, to seek out and destroy evil's champions, and to carry the banner of purity and light. Although many rally to the Silver Flame, only a select few ever feel its purifying flames burn away the darkness clouding their souls and receive true clarity of vision. One does not choose to become a vessel for the Silver Flame, but rather, the Flame chooses him or her to be a vessel.
As a sublime flame, you have unflinching devotion and piety, and you are dedicated to serving the principles on which the Church of the Silver Flame was founded. You might serve the Church faithfully, or perhaps instead you commune directly with the Silver Flame. Regardless, your devotion unlocks a deeper understanding of your purpose in the world.

Mourning Panacea: Once you complete your final quest and unlock the Mourning's secret, you realize what must be done to remove the taint that plagues the land. Only through sacrifice can you contain the wellspring of evil that contaminates Cyre. Once you make peace with this terrible task, you walk into the Mournland and vanish into its mists.
For a time, there is no change. As the seasons pass, though, the gloom shrouding Cyre thins. The horrors stalking the ruined landscape turn against one another in an orgy of violence. When the transformation is complete, nothing remains of the magical phenomenon that erased an entire nation. Wreckage lies strewn across the countryside, but rather than disheartening the Cyran refugees, it emboldens them. They resolve to rebuild what was lost and restore their homeland to its former glory. You might be an unsung hero, but through your sacrifice, the Mourning is reversed, and life can thrive in Cyre once more. </specific>

In the final years of the Last War, prophets and soothsayers warned of impending doom. They described a singular event that would change the face of Khorvaire and bring ruin and death to the land. These warnings culminated with the Day of Mourning, and none can now deny the truth of these prophecies. A few of Cyre's survivors remember that these same mystics also spoke of salvation, of a person who would undo what had befallen Cyre. This person, the prophets said, would heal the land and prevent similar catastrophes from ravaging the world. You are the mourning savior the foretellings predicted, chosen by the Prophecy to stand fast against the threat of the Mournland and stop its corruption from spreading farther across Khorvaire.

Knowledge is power, freedom, life, and love. With the proper information, you can unravel the secrets of the universe and be the master of your own fate. You have always believed this. Your curiosity about all things is legendary. Even as a child, you asked “why?” more often than any other question. As you matured, you sought knowledge about harder-to-reach places, traveling first the world, then other planes of existence. Knowledge is your solace, your hope, and your support. Faith might be fine for others, but you see it as a shallow edifice. Only objective study and the knowledge gained thereby allows one to see things as they truly are.
The petty bickering of kings and nobles holds less and less interest for you, and as you learn more and more about the facade of flesh that mortals wear to hide their souls, even earthly delights begin to lose their flavor. All else pales before the pursuit of pure knowledge.

The world is not real. It is a story whose teller is the cosmos itself, a cosmos unaware of its own ongoing process of coming more fully into being. Time is an illusion, merely a prop for the unfolding tale. Without time, matter, too, is mere imagination. Gods and mortals, primordials and angels, and every other creature that strives, lives, and dies upon the stage of supposed existence, is facade thrown up by the cosmos. The solid-seeming earth is anything but, and the distinctions between the heavenly realms and the infernalmost pits is a paper-thin fiction.
Or, at least, such is your creed, and you have good reason to believe it's true. The wise know that stories are narratives that give structure to knowledge, and you are wiser than most. This narrative principle runs far more deeply than most presume—you believe it is the core axiom of creation itself. However, knowing reality for the illusion it is, you have begun to alter your own story. In so doing, you have risen above the masses that still believe r ealityis more than a cloak over the nothingness that lies beneath everything. In taking a hand in your own tale, you have become a living parable, perhaps one capable of wrenching existence onto a track designed by you.

Your reputation as a powerful spellcaster has only grown in the telling, perhaps sometimes even outpacing your actual abilities. Indeed, some credulous few have gone so far as to call you the “mouth of magic,” implying that you are the ultimate expert on all things arcane.
You don't go out of your way to dissuade such talk. After all, you are a powerful practitioner of the arcane arts. You are a protégé of powerful wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks (if not in the f lesh, at least in the study of their lives, their rituals, and the spells they preferred to cast). Furthermore, spells and rituals have been your daily fare for longer than you can recall. You are mortal, yes, but the f lux of magic that daily f lows through your form lifts you closer and closer to something finer with each arcane utterance.
Any wizard, warlock, or other spellcaster can study hard and eventually master a wide variety of magical stratagems. It is not impossible to grow in power and ability. But a few who do so sense an underlying unity to magic, a thread that connects apparently disparate magical functions. Those few, like you, claim the title of Magister and the enhanced magical prowess that goes with it.
Regardless of what others say or what you believe, empirical evidence has proved it: You have become one of the most powerful spellcasters in history. You manipulate magic as easily as you breathe.

You have mastered whole libraries of arcane lore. With all that knowledge, you have glimpsed a universal truth: A cosmic balance hides behind all things, weighing the energies of existence and perhaps judging them. Life, motion, and the intricacy of existence itself participate in a constant interaction of warring forces, but a war subtly harmonized by the balance.
Your understanding of this balance informs your actions. Seeing the need for moderation in all things, you seek to damp down fiery passions and heartwrenching attachments. If you attack the forces of evil, or struggle against chaos, you do so simply to bring the adversary back into a state of balance with virtue and order. You accept that life must include both despair and joy, both beauty and horror.
You are becoming an agent of balance—a living exemplar of the cosmic fulcrum.

Magic is less complex than most believe it to be. Beneath the incantations, the beautifully fashioned implements, the intricately carved circles and sigils, and the lore scribbled in tomes unnumbered lies one simple truth: Everything is energy. Energy comes in many forms, but once the first fundamental truth is grasped, all later use of magic becomes applied manipulation of energy. Energy can be tuned, directed, drawn away, or multiplied. It can be slowed so that it seems to be a solid, or converted to an insubstantial fluid of potential.
Others who lack your understanding find you obscure or mystical, but in fact you could not be more practical. In the grand scheme of things, only energy is eternal and true; all its shapes and flows are temporary, and will shift into unrecognizable patterns as time advances.
Your comprehension of these truths grants you exceptional and growing power over the world that others believe is mostly physical. Hazardous discharges flow around you like water. You can even extend a fraction of your protection to your allies. So powerful is your control over energy that when your body takes too much hurt, you can convert yourself to a field of substanceless particles.

Your mastery over the mystical arts that twine through the Feywild has earned you the respect of eladrin and other noble fey creatures. You are seen as a great leader in the sometimes fanciful, wondrous echo of the world. Where castles of eladrin nobles raise their gleaming spires, your name has been bandied about as a potential lord of great power. Where shadowed hillocks cover twilight tunnels into the brooding Feydark, your name is also whispered, but as a curse.
As a lord of the Feywild, you are sometimes called upon to use your power to defend the interests of the faerie realm. However, your interests are wider still, and you often use your knowledge and ties to aid you in your own quests and errands. Sometimes, a future version of yourself steps back through the world lines to offer aid, and in so doing provide a glimpse of what one day might be in a fey echo of reality.

In your expert opinion, of all the varied spells that have passed the lips of casters down the ages, there is one whose elegance, power, and conceptual fundamental beauty surpasses all others. You should know, because you have endured much to master it. You refer to this spell of spells (with some pride) as your “signature spell.”
Other arcane characters might cast the same spell, but your study of it, with an attention to detail none could ever hope to match, has unlocked intricacies of the power that have been lost on all others. Of course, it would be impossible to research every spell in your arsenal with such exacting care. There is not time enough in any one life for such a project. That's why you have chosen just one spell to devote yourself to entirely. A single spell, one which no other creature will ever cast as magnificently as you cast it.
Sometimes you take pity on others you happen to encounter that also cast your signature spell. You might approach these unenlightened mages and offer them encouragement, and explain to them that one day they might be great, but only if they improve their technique with the spell in question. If they show interest, you are more than happy to demonstrate your skill with your spell.
As you progress in power and mastery, your reputation as a connoisseur of your signature spell also grows. In fact, your name begins to become synonymous with the spell. You can hardly imagine anything more satisfying: With every casting, your name, too, is spoken aloud.

You pursue eternal life as an undead creature. Most wizards who search for and achieve easy immortality by way of esoteric necromantic texts are evil, avaricious spellcasters who stop at nothing to achieve their ultimate goals. For some, that goal is lichdom itself. But you have a greater, nobler purpose.
Unlike many who have become liches before you, you have trained your mind to avoid succumbing to the madness that necromantic preservation often brings. For instance, you did not perform the foul ritual that traded your life for animation the moment you found it; you waited until your power was equal to the change. Nor did you accept the aid of Orcus, Demon Prince of the Undead, to empower the ritual, but you waited to find methods outside his control. In doing so, you escaped his touch, though you bear his personal enmity to this day.

Your strength waxes and wanes with the seasons' passage, growing stronger as summer turns to autumn, and coming into your full potential when winter takes hold, only to wane as the days lengthen, ice recedes, and the snows melt.

Each archfey governs an aspect of the Feywild, laying claim to the mountains, the forests, the Feydark, or even the seasons themselves. Your life's work places you on the path to join this august society by ascending mortality and becoming an immortal guardian of world's bright echo. Your future role could be anything, but your fate is to become master of snow and ice—the Ruler of Winter in the Feywild.
The moment you realized the life you would one day lead, you have bent your efforts to understanding the Feywild and its denizens, while also working to master the elements you will have to wield. You might study under the current Winter King or Queen, or you might secretly work to usurp the role, leaching power from your rival for the fateful moment when you will supplant the monarch and stake your claim to the dark season. However you go about learning your role, your mastery over winter's frigid power only grows.

Elemental Chaos. Far from any living creature, you relaxed yourself, surrendering your body and soul to the primordial, allowing it to unleash the storm's fury. You thought this would mean your annihilation, and in a way, the freeing did end your life, but your consciousness lives on by merging with the elemental entity, to give a mind to the mindless storm, and life to the personification of violence. Thus do you become a new primordial—a master of the elements and agent of creation and destruction—and thus do you fade from the world to emerge as a great power in the Elemental Chaos. </specific>

You are the scion of storms, the master of thunder and lightning, and a prince of the Elemental Chaos. Others are like you—others who feel an uncommon bond with the elemental forces who spawned the world and who harbor a measure of elemental power within them. Some don't yet realize the fate in store for them, while others might never attain their potential, but you are different, because your eyes crackle with lightning, your hair stirs as if in a breeze, and your voice thunders. The primordial heirs, as some might call you and those like you, might find comfort in the mountain heights or in the ocean's deeps, but your connection is within the savage storm and those blistering explosions of wind and rain, of blinding lightning and deafening thunder—storms in which you feel truly free and your purpose never more clear.
As you come to know your place in the wider world, you connections to mortal creatures strains. Your home is not among the civilized cities or in the darkened wilds, but it is in the sea of possibility that is the Elemental Chaos. You seek to dance through drifting motes of boiling earth, to lash seas of fire with your rains, and to destroy any who do not kneel before you. Only your purpose can hold back these wild impulses, and only your sense of duty and the burden of responsibility can ground you. One day, though, you'll escape and embrace the nature you have long suppressed.

You drew the attention of not just one god, but all of them. Perhaps they fear you or seek to control you. Maybe they hope to channel your destructive energy for another purpose, but whatever their motives, should you accept the burden they lay on you, your immortality is assured.
Hand of Vengeance: You're not the forgiving type; you don't let affronts go unpunished. When someone crosses you, you carry a grudge until you give them what they gave, sevenfold. In your line of work, this frequently means your hands are bloody from the merciless slaughter of those who stood against you. The killing doesn't bother you in the slightest, because it's what you do and who you are.
Long success in the killing business earned a few nods of approval from the movers and shakers of the universe, and probably a few nasty encounters with a god, a primordial, an archfey, or another power with an axe to grind. By the time you grab the gods' attention, you've accumulated so many enemies that you have a hard time going anywhere without facing another fight.
Through all your adventures, you've had the feeling you've been doing work for a greater purpose and fulfilling a grand design as laid out by a higher power or powers. What at first seemed like dishing out payback became something more—something almost holy. The revelation crystallizes when you dispatch the last villain, a horrible wretch whose death was long overdue, because the gods send their aspects to congratulate you on your accomplishment. Such is your success, they bequeath onto you the punisher's mantle, naming you their hand of vengeance and dispenser of divine justice. To you it falls to seek out and destroy those who would threaten the gods and their creation, whether it be a primordial, a demon prince, or even another god. In exchange for your service, you win a place among the gods, free to move through the cosmos and to attend the divine courts of your masters as a favored servant, and, perhaps eventually, as a valued peer. </specific>

Blood fills your footsteps, and a thousand screaming souls rage in your wake. It is almost an unbearable burden, this task set before you; your duty is to seek out and destroy those who would oppose the gods and their will.
The choice to become a Punisher of the Gods was never yours to make; the gods themselves choose you for this task, naming you enemy of their enemies and their dealer of death. You are not sworn to any one god, but rather you serve them all, good and evil, as well as those who choose not to take a stand one way or the other. You were chosen because you have an unshakeable resolve and a drive that helps you see more victories than defeats, and through your achievements, you now have the chance for immortality.

There are many paths to joining the archdevils' ranks, and they include murder, betrayal, treachery, and everything in between. The following describes one possible route to a palace overlooking a sea of fire.
Infernal Apotheosis: Knowing what's in store for you, you spent your career working to secure a place of power within the Nine Hells' hierarchy. You might take a hand in infernal politics, moving through mortal spheres to pit the archdevils and their dukes against one another, or you might wage war against a particular archdevil, vowing to end the dark lord's evil regime. Regardless of the method, your final enemy's defeat brings about the appointed hour and your time in the mortal world is at an end.
For your efforts, Asmodeus summons you to his grim palace in a puff of brimstone smoke. The Lord of Nessus demands your fealty, compelling you to intone the blasphemous oaths of service whether you want to or not. In recognition for your mortal deeds, you are awarded a domain within the Nine Hells, perhaps as a vassal to another archdevil or replacing an archdevil as a lord of Hell, gaining its lands, vassals, and armies to use as you wish.
You ascent is not without its peril. Hidden enemies plot against you, while you might find it hard to stomp out old loyalties to the one you supplanted. As well, the devils are ever working against one another, each casting hungry eyes at their peer's lands. In theory, you will live forever as an immortal steward of a brooding land, but some are ready to slip a knife in your back or send armies to shatter your legions. At any time, another ambitious fool with designs on your demesne might be prepared to use the luck and favor granted by the same dread forces that raised you up. </specific>

One way or another, you're going to Hell. The reasons are many. You might have drawn the fell attention of an archdevil who seeks to name you as its heir. You might have made an unwise bargain, selling your soul in exchange for temporal power. Or you could be a devil's lost scion, only now realizing your heritage's full potential. It might not be fair and could be a gross injustice, but you can't change fate. Your place lies within the fiery dominion and only by accepting your destiny can you use it to your advantage.
Undoubtedly, your curse (or blessing) has manifested itself in omens and the behavior of those you meet. Babies cry, animals grow uneasy, and your eyes have a tendency to flash red when you're angry, all pointing toward darkness in your blood. Consultations with seers and soothsayers offer glimpses of what's in store for you, including grim warnings of plots and treacheries fomented hidden rivals and enemy archdevils who fear your ascent. Indeed, the emergence of a new archdevil comes at a price to those who hold their own kingdoms in the Nine Hells, and none are willing to surrender their might to an upstart mortal. As a result, enemies lay in wait to all sides, plotting and conniving to bring about your downfall.
Contrary to what you might expect, you don't have to be evil to rule in the Nine Hells, though being all dark and nasty goes far to making sure you hold onto what you take. Anyone with a firm hand can claim a place in the infernal realms, and maybe, just maybe, change the dominion in a small way, at least until the Lord of Nessus smacks you down.

Though malleable in your hands, the world proves too limiting to one of your stature and talent, and so you transcend your origins to embrace your destiny.
Master of Reality: From the moment you discovered the astral seed, you have spent a measure of your time and energy to crafting this realm. Although you and a few allies eventually became able to explore the product of your work, it isn't until you complete your final quest that the growing realm awakens into a full-blown dominion—an Astral realm and haven for you and any you permit to walk its lands. With your refuge ready, you gather your things and slip through the planes to bring about its final form, raising mountains, forming seas, and welcoming those creatures you like to share in its splendor for as long as they wish to remain.
Being the master of your own realm and having complete control over its nature finds you distancing yourself from your roots. The squabbles between kingdoms, the rise and fall of empires, and the drama of ordinary people are insignificant next to the power you wield and the concerns facing you with maintaining your ever-growing dominion. Moreover,  maintaining your dominion takes work and consumes much of your attention until your forays outside your realm become fewer and fewer and until you find yourself unwilling to leave the paradise you create. In your final days, you bind your soul to the realm to preserve it forever after and thus your immortality is ensured as a testament of your imagination. </specific>

The dominions are stars in the firmament of the Astral Sea and each houses a fantastic world that evolved first from a seed of a concept and eventually blossomed into a unique world reflecting the vision and imagination from which it was spawned. Though many dominions are in the Astral Sea, others wait to take shape and join those already drifting through the silvery void. You have discovered one of these unformed realms and it's up to you to decide what form it will take.
The astral seed's evolution is slow, gradually expanding and transforming in response to your guidance. You cannot rush its formation or it will rip apart and dissolve into the silvery mists. You must also learn to hone your craft so you can develop the precision needed to sculpt the realm properly. Having the ability to create and alter the nature of this dominion in the making breeds other talents that transcend your mastery over the Astral Sea, and you bring these abilities to bear no matter where you go. You, however, apprehend these forces of creation, at first through subtle manipulation, but eventually through an unnerving mastery and ease foreshadowing your coming greatness.

The cosmos opens its doors to you, inviting you into the remotest corners of reality. It's not a question of how or when you travel, but where do you want to go?
Master of Time and Space: Yours has been a life of exploration, traveling to the farthest reaches of reality and back again. You've beheld wondrous vistas, watched residuum storms raging across the Feywild, explored the City of Brass's gleaming streets, and wandered through Sigil's innumerable portals. Each time you embarked on a new journey, you began to realize that the mechanisms and arcane formulae used in travel rituals were imperfect methods for movement, since they were overly complex systems that exacted an unnecessary price. These potent rituals only touched the possibilities for travel, providing the crudest and most direct means to reach your destination. Through refinement and exploiting the pathways worming through reality, you could speed up the process and make it more elegant so that you could go anywhere you liked.
This understanding proved instrumental in your victory over your final adversary. With the enemy brought low, and your quest completed, you are free to devote your full time and attention to exploring the planes, and not long after, you say your goodbyes and put your knowledge to the test. As you refine your techniques, you find you no longer need the complexities of ritual magic to facilitate your exploration; you can simply go where you want, when you want. Eventually, you discover the very threads of time, which allows you to move into the future and into the past.
Being able to traverse the currents of time means you can effectively live forever, journeying to all times and places. You might race backward into history to witness the rise and fall of Bael Turath, or go further to behold the horrors of creation's war between the gods and primordials. Or, you might move ahead, stepping into the uncertain future to see the repercussions of your mortal actions, the ascent of new champions, new wars, new innovations, and more until the world you left behind becomes a dim memory. If you drift into the past, will you seek to change it or preserve it from other Keybearers? If you go into the future, will you return to the present to change it? Only you can decide as master of time and space. </specific>

The keys are a metaphor for your unique insight into reality's architecture. Your keen insight allows you to identify holes in the cosmos's fabric and with slight concentration, you can step through them to bypass obstacles, appear miles away, or emerge in an entirely different plane. Your first breakthrough might have come early in your career, when you first used a Linked Portal or another travel ritual. Or it could have arisen from your experimentation with spells, prayers, or other powers you have mastered. These revelations laid the foundation for the evolving abilities you come to master, but also instilled a powerful urge to travel and explore, to visit new realms, explore distant planes, and meet peoples and societies alien from your own.

You claim your place as master of the Shadowfell, a dark and mysterious figure of uncertain loyalties commanding a region in the Shadowfell as absolute ruler, monarch of night, and prince of darkness. 
Shadow's Price: Your interests in the Shadowfell have only grown over your long career and in return, you learn to tap into its grim power to augment your other capabilities. Dabbling in dark forces exacts a dread price from you, for you have paled and grown thin—the cost of embracing the darkness.
During the last conflict with your enemy, you pulled out all the stops, using every tool at your disposal to win the day, but in doing so, you cemented the Shadowfell's hold over your soul. When the battle ends, as your achievements begin to sink in, mist wells up from the ground around you in silvery tendrils, each wrapping chill fingers around your legs, crawling up your torso until it shrouds you completely. As quickly as the mists appeared, though, so do they vanish and when they do, they take you with them.
The Shadowfell's price is to stake a claim on your soul and to demand you spend eternity as a Darklord, a ruler of the gloomy plane. The plane manifests a realm suited to your accomplishments and failures, producing a darkly twisted realm that for you is both frightening and comforting, and that reflects all that you have done as a mortal and laying the foundation for what you will do as an immortal.

Some say that the Shadowfell reflects darkly the mortal world and is an imperfect echo of that realm suspended in reality's heart. Where others fear the unexpected twists, the deep shadows, and the scuttling creatures that emerge from hiding only in the darkest of nights, you embrace it all, feeling at home in the plane's pervasive chill and gloomy ambience. Perhaps your comfort grows from familiarity; you might have been born in the Shadowfell, perhaps as a shadar-kai, or another race who settled here, and, as a result, you come to see other worlds as being too bright and too garish to trust completely. Or, you might find the Shadowfell mirroring your own dark and brooding nature, especially if you are obsessed with death and dark magic. Regardless of the reasons for your unhealthy obsession with shadow, the kinship you experience blossoms into something more as the Shadowfell reciprocates your affection and blesses you with its power.
The Shadowfell isn't free with its gifts and only gradually infuses you based on your achievements and successes. As you prove your worth, you find yourself changing, embracing the cool darkness and rejecting the bright radiance of the sun. You become withdrawn and cold, even to your closest comrades, while your connections to the Shadowfell strengthen. Dark impulses might breed darker acts, but there is nothing to fear: The Shadowfell chose you to become its steward, and should you accept, your immortality is ensured.
Although the Darklord is available to characters of any class, strikers and controllers are best suited to its features and power.

Just taking on the fragment of Heur-Ket makes you an agent of destiny, and a piece in the eternal conflict between the deities and primordials.

The gods of Hestavar and their servants, and even other powers of the Astral Sea from angels to githyanki, to devils, attempt to push your actions toward the primordial's destruction.
	The entire time, your existence is on a short fuse. For as long as you hold the essence, you can gain power from it, but it slowly erodes body, animus, and soul until you finally fulfill your destiny.
	Destruction of Heur-Ket: If you choose the right path, perform the correct deeds and fulfill the correct prophecies, you can destroy the remaining essence of this primordial. The Eye of Storm diminishes and finally dissipates completely, and Ioun calls you to her service as an esteemed member of her cognoscenti. 
	Resurrection of Heur-Ket: Choose poorly, or be swayed toward the side of primordials, and you could ultimately release Heur-Ket's essence, which would lead to the resurrection of this dangerous primordial.
	Ultimate Destruction: As has happened to the many that have come before you, the burden of imprisoning even a fragment of a primordial's essence has taken its toll. As your body is finally eroded by its power, you can take small comfort in the fact that you did not herald its resurrection, and you will be remembered as one of the few who tried to tame the seemingly untamable winds of Heur-Ket. </specific>

Upon entering the Eye of the Storm in Hestavar, a sliver of the primordial's remaining essence entered you, like it has hundreds of other powerful in the millennia before your coming. You have become the Prison of the Winds, and it might be your destiny to either finally destroy the primordial Heur-Ket, or as some fear, finally release it, so that it can renew its ancient assault upon the Astral Sea. But there is a great danger. You are not the first being to take on this burden, and all who have come before you have been utterly destroyed by the destructive chaos of Heur-Ket's churning essence.

Your teachings are destined to bring hope and enlightenment to people for centuries to come, for glimpses of truth lie within the words you have set down and within the story of your deeds.
Your philosophy might seem, at first glance, to trivialize the gods and their dominions, but you recognize that the gods are necessary intermediaries between mortals and the infinite. You therefore honor all deities as examples for mortals to learn from. Your sermons, your writings, or the stories of your life have the power to help followers of many different gods to understand the lessons of the mortal world.
The exact nature of your revelations is up to you. You might be a visionary who perceives the eventual fate of mortal souls and teaches others how their actions in this world influence their ultimate destinies. You might be a reformer whose teachings challenge inflexible, age-old doctrines of great temples. You might be a philosopher who maintains a creed of stoicism, a fiery condemnation of evil, or an ethical system of obligation to others. Or perhaps you instruct your initiates in darker truths that incite greed, hedonism, or tyranny—not all who follow this path find philosophies of peace and enlightenment, after all.

Lorekeepers are among the most learned people in the world, and they rely on their vast knowledge to battle those who embrace ignorance and reject civilization.
Grand Library: The ultimate expression of your temporal power is the construction of a grand library to hold your collection. By the time you complete your Destiny Quest, you have acquired more books, manuscripts, and other texts than you can catalog. The only way to prevent certain suspect writings from falling into the wrong hands is to construct a place to protect them. Whether you build your edifice in the mortal world, adrift in the Astral Sea, or hidden within the City of Brass, Sigil, or Gloomwrought, this grand library ensures your immortality. The library reminds all who behold its wonders of your singleminded commitment to preserving lore and your great deeds in pursuit of knowledge. </specific>

You are a font of knowledge, a peerless scholar, and a custodian of legends, myths, and, above all, truth. Though you content yourself with study and reflection, people come to you from all over the world, and beyond it, for an audience. They seek to apply your keen intellect and wisdom to any number of problems: locating a long-lost artifact, solving an impossible riddle, or devising a strategy to overcome a horde of raging berserkers. Others seek you out just to talk, learn, and expand their own understanding.
With such knowledge comes grave responsibility, for some truths are best kept secret. If you glibly reveal the location of a powerful weapon lost since the fall of an ancient civilization, you might very well doom the world to witnessing firsthand that weapon's power. If you withhold the cure to a plague, the deaths of its victims rest upon your shoulders. Ultimately, you must decide whether you hoard your knowledge or dispense it freely, and whether you have the wisdom to know what to reveal and what to hide.

Nothing remains of you, but you are remembered in the world's myths and legends as an agent of change and destruction.

You are an omen of storms, a herald of destruction, a spreader of calamity—wherever you go, destinies are unraveled and woven anew. You have broken free of the bonds of fate, and for you, nothing is written. Every step along your path, every decision you make, forces the future to shape itself accordingly. The ripples spreading from your choices can topple kings, wake ancient terrors, ruin kingdoms, and thwart the designs of the gods themselves.
The most dire consequences of your choices befall those people, realms, or causes to which you choose to give battle. Misfortunes, accidents, and natural disasters gather around your enemies when you are near—minor flukes at first, such as a hailstorm that ruins a crop, a messenger delayed by a few important hours when his horse throws a shoe, or a servant who forgets to secure a gate. You can't control these happenings, or even guess how they might take shape. In fact, ill chance often falls upon those you do not wish to harm, although not in the same measure as your enemies suffer. You dare not linger in places you love, lest you inadvertently destroy the things you hold dear.

In the darkest days of the divine war against the primordials, when those agents of oblivion seemed fated to tear down the divine works and unravel creation itself, the gods' heralds joined voices and spurred mortal champions to fight back. Their song made heroes of common folk, giving them the resolve to stand fast against the tide of enemies around them. These early heralds live on still in the legends and tales of their descendants, and without their emboldening song, the world might have come to an end.
You have studied the Song of Heroes, and you know that all great champions still hear its melody. They might not be aware of it, but at some point they, like you, caught a faint note of it. The distant strains of this ancient song—hidden in an uplifting tune, perhaps, or half-remembered in a stirring call to action—provide the inspiration that mortals need to rise above the mundane and become legends.

You are one with the world around you. You hear the whispers of the trees as they speak of their ancient dreams, you taste the change of seasons carried on the four winds, and you understand the thoughts of beasts nearby. The world of spirit that exists alongside the physical world is as real to you as your own body; you perceive and move in both realms at the same time. Like the wisest and most powerful barbarians, druids, shamans, and wardens who have gone before you, you have no fear of death, for when you die, you will reside in the spirit world that you already know.
Many primal spirits are benign. Some are heedless of mortal concerns, and others are actively malevolent. Your power and attunement to their world draws these spirits' attention, for they perceive you even as you perceive them. Hostile spirits see you as a threat and seek to hamper your progress. But you have allies in the spirit realm too, friendly powers who nurture you, lending a measure of their own strength to support your cause. As your power grows, so too does your connection to the spirits of nature, until its sustaining power accompanies you wherever you go.
Your presence in the world has such resonance that a great primal spirit might seek you out to recruit you for a greater purpose. Whether you choose to bind yourself to the entity or not has no effect on your abilities, but service might result in physical manifestations that evoke qualities held by your patron. For example, if you ally yourself with a spirit of the woodlands, your hair might take on a leafy appearance that changes with the passing of the seasons; if you choose to serve a spirit of the hunt, you might acquire a bestial appearance and a shaggy mane; and if you serve an animal spirit of wisdom and guidance, you might grow a stagís antlers or develop hooves for feet.

	True Redemption: Upon completing your final quest, you were plucked from the mortal world and escorted by Corellon's chosen servants to make your final journey to his dominion in the Astral Sea. There, standing before the great and mighty god, your mortal deeds are weighed and judged, your accomplishments celebrated, and your failings considered. In the end, the god lifts the curse from you. For a moment, you see yourself as you were originally formed, before the betrayal—before the fall—and all falls dark. In a blink of an eye, you awaken once more, your soul contained in a new infant body.

No matter the deeds done, no matter the life lived, none of your mortal actions change the fact that you are drow—a dark elf and a living symbol of mortal corruption and vice—and throughout the rest of your days, you must bear the burden of the understanding that nothing you do can ever lift the stain that darkens your heart. The only escape from the curse is to truly transcend the mortal coil and become something more—to leave behind the shell of flesh and bone so your true light can shine and reveal to all the purity of your purpose. To this end, you commit yourself to become more than drow and deny the Spider Queen her hold over you for all time.
	Becoming a redeemed drow represents a drow's ultimate repudiation of the Spider Queen. With this complete and total denial, you escape the webs of her influence and attain a higher state of existence. You name Lolth as your enemy and commit your life to fighting her machinations and ploys, in the hopes of showing the world and the gods that you have succeeded in breaking your ties where others have failed.
	Your successes earn you the attention of Corellon (and possibly others), who aids you in your crusade against your former kin by imbuing you with a greater sense of purpose to impel you to daring acts and astonishing deeds. As your mission nears completion, Lolth throws the full weight of her legions against you, and through the storm of demons, spiders, driders, and drow, you must stand fast before the blooming doubts and misgivings that threaten to cloud your vision. In the end, Corellon blesses you with the greatest gift you could ask for: a second chance at life without the filthy caress of the horrific Spider Queen.

Legendary sovereigns come to power in a variety of ways. Some are born to royalty—the scions of existing dynasties. These sovereigns reverse the flagging fortunes of their homelands, defeat ancestral enemies, or usher in ages of expansion and prosperity. Other sovereigns establish new dynasties, building monarchies to heal a land or carve a new kingdom out of the wilderness. A few legendary sovereigns seize power by deposing tyrants and leading nations to freedom. Finally, a handful of legendary sovereigns win their thrones by acclaim. They are chosen by the people to take up the mantle of leadership after performing deeds of renown and demonstrating wisdom and courage.

In the days before acceding to your throne, you won ever-growing renown throughout the land you were destined to rule. An anonymous adventurer in other lands, you were a hero to the people of your home. People crowded the streets to catch a glimpse of you. You accrued accolades, honors, and titles, and the people began to wonder whether you might someday claim the throne. As threats arose, the people of the land sought your opinions and counsel. They treated you as a great leader, and soon, your destiny to become a lord was apparent.

The Harpers are a secret society of good heroes who work against tyranny and darkness. Centuries ago, seven gods and goddesses opposed to evil and oppression— Corellon, Mielikki, Mystra, Oghma, Selûne, Silvanus, and Tymora—met one night in the sacred glade known as the Dancing Place to collectively extend their blessings to mortals who vowed to battle against the darkness. Harpers who serve long and well, showing exceptional wisdom and compassion, eventually earn the accolade of Master Harper. And a few Master Harpers who become the greatest champions of this ancient order become legendary figures, mantled in the divine blessings bestowed by the Seven long ago. You are a Harper of Legend, one of the most honored members of the society with a long record of bold deeds and daring exploits to your credit.
	The Harpers have existed for twelve centuries in one form or another; the current one is the third incarnation of the ancient society. The Harpers of today were founded sixty years ago on the ashes of the previous society, which was split into opposing factions by the actions of Khelben Blackstaff a decade before the Spellplague and then overwhelmed in the chaos of the Spellplague years. For a time it seemed that this noble tradition would pass from the world entirely, but a small spark survived. Eaerlraun Shadowlyn, Master of Moongleam Tower in Everlund, kept alive the Harper traditions and nurtured a new generation of Harpers. In the shadows of Netheril he saw the greatest threat confronting the free peoples of Faerûn, and he dedicated his life to building a secret society capable of checking the shades' designs and uniting their enemies against them. So it is that today the Harpers are Netheril's secret enemies, and the protectors of Luruar, Evereska, the Dalelands, and all other people who stand against Netheril's dominion.

Joining yourself to a mythal, you greatly strengthen an ancient work, infusing it with an arcane lifeforce so that it can heal, grow, and change over time. From time to time your people summon your consciousness to the fore to seek your advice and to honor the memory of your living wisdom and heroism. </specific>

For twenty thousand years the elves of Faerûn have created wonders of magic greater and more enduring than any work in stone or wood. Dimensional gates, invisible roadways linking distant points, hidden vaults, mighty mythal wards to protect kingdoms, cities buttressed by unfailing spells—all these things and more were crafted by high magic, the very pinnacle of the elven arcane arts. With high magic the elves of old sundered Evermeet from the world, created the extradimensional realm of Sildëyuir, and broke the power of Faerûn's draconic rulers by binding them to the Rage. Others have harnessed magic of similar power at different times in Faerûn's history—the Netherese, the Imaskari, the Shoon—but few of their works ever matched the longevity, the artistry, or the world-changing scope of the spells wrought by elven high magic.
	The secrets of this powerful and dangerous lore are in the keeping of the selutaar, or the Elf High Mages. In the days of the great elven kingdoms of the Crown Wars there were hundreds of Elf High Mages, but today only a handful remains in the world. (Most of the Elf High Mages are sun elves, moon elves, and star elves, so they might more properly be called Eladrin High Mages, but such distinctions are lost on those who aren't elves.) Usually the path to high magic is a long one indeed; an elf or eladrin is rarely considered ready for instruction in this ancient art before he or she reaches 300 years of age, and many begin their instruction decades later. However, a few exceptional individuals—for example, the sun elf Araevin Teshurr, who reshaped the mythal of Myth Drannor in the years following the reconquest of that realm—have defied this custom in the past.
	Although any Elf High Mage is a potent arcane spellcaster by definition, an Elf High Mage's true power does not lie in mastery of battle magic. Elven high magic consists of a set of rare and powerful rituals, mostly dealing with the creation of mythals, which are permanent magical wardings woven over a wide area in which the mage can anchor many different protective or useful effects. The most powerful such rituals require multiple Elf High Mages to combine their efforts for months of arduous spellcasting.

Is being clever in war enough? For a time, you thought so. You wore each victory as a badge of honor, and you used these triumphs as a means to validate the death wrought at your order. Yet as each victory became more and more sure, you began to wonder if you would ever face a challenge worthy of your talents.
	Eternal War: As you have done countless times before, you set your brilliant mind to the task of defeating your enemies, bringing to a close your final quest. Though you are victorious, a realization crashes upon you as you understand that with this last triumph no mortal mind can outmaneuver you, catch you unawares, or surprise you with some unexpected ploy. Your keen wit and pragmatism have secured your place in the annals of history, your name written in the blood of the vanquished. Who will stand against you now that you have defeated the undefeatable? Wins are wins, to be sure, but you want—you need—a challenge. There will be none here, for who will stand against you? No, you must leave this world to pass into the realm of legend, where you might find a worthy foe.
	The legend you see is the Eternal War, the ultimate battlefield that draws the greatest commanders to test their brilliance and cunning against their equals, to fight onward until the end of days when the best of them are chosen to lead the armies of light in one final confrontation against the hordes of darkness. Such a locale might be nothing more than a myth, but if there's a chance that you could find a place among these great warlords, it's a chance worth the risk of failure. </specific>

Surviving countless battles, endless engagements, you carry memories of faces—foes you have dispatched over your career of waging war. You have won more victories than you can count, defeated more enemies than anyone could hope to remember. Some call you lucky, blessed, or cursed. Others say you're brilliant, possessed of a tactical mind unrivaled in the modern age. The truth is that while you have benefited from uncommon good luck and a superior strategic skill, your successes stand on your unwillingness to give up and to use whatever advantages you had in order to win.
	Your victories drew the interest of the great and mighty, from kings to exarchs, angelic lords to demon princes. You have crossed swords and wits with legendary leaders whose talents are every bit as sharp as your own. Each time you have managed to survive. If you didn't emerge with decisive victory, you left all your adversaries with a battle to remember.

On the verge of your climactic confrontation, your body and soul become one. It seems you can't die.
	To Live Forever: When you have reached your career's destined end point, your immortality is assured. Simultaneously a being of soul and body, you pass through death's final mystery only if you choose to do so. Until you decide to abandon your body, it is your vehicle to eternity.
	You could retire peacefully, perhaps taking up residence with your preferred deity. Fame and skill could serve you well as you live in a remote place in the world or among the planes, perhaps establishing a tradition to pass on your knowledge to younger would-be heroes. Alongside a Legendary General, you might fight the battle everlasting, or you could keep a vigil like that of the Eternal Defender. Perhaps you'll wander without end, or take up a wild card position in the cosmos. One day, you might ascend to literal godhood.
	Your options are as limitless as your time now is. In the endless future, you might learn the method of your transfiguration into an undying being or some other form of wisdom the world needs. You choose whether to share this knowledge or to let it pass away if you finally give up everlasting life. </specific>

	You might choose to lead such creatures, guiding them along mortality's fickle paths. Instead, you could work as an operative of the Raven Queen, maybe even as a commander above cadres of the sorrowsworn. Perhaps to serve in shadow isn't good enough for you, and as other mortal beings have attempted before, you will challenge the beings of the cosmos that contend for authority over death. Could you be the one that determines who has that final authority?

If you tire of destruction, even the righteous kind, you can instead remove yourself from the cares of the world. You could live on quietly in a secluded part of existence, possibly in the company of your longtime allies.

	The battle between the gods and the primordials ended eons ago. Strife among planar agencies is still common, and the balance could tip to spark war across the cosmos yet again. Deities, especially malevolent ones, plot against one another to the detriment of all. Elemental powers still look with vengeful eyes upon the world and the heavens. Fey entities, and those of shadow, occasionally raise armies to shake the pillars of the universe. Hordes of demons threaten the very roots of existence. Until an unforeseen age takes hold in which evil is quelled and want is subdued, peace and stability feel tenuous. The need for a leader of legendary skill remains constant.
	Is it your greater destiny to stand at the fore of united angelic legions as they hold back the chaos? Will you lead the gods to victory over their ancient foes? Do you prefer the side of the primordials? Might you command archons and efreets as they seize dominions in the Astral Sea, usurping the usurpers?

You left home ages ago, saying goodbye to the comforts that a simpler life might have held. Following an unspoken yearning, you took to the road with other vagabonds. Your way led along sinister paths and to fateful deeds. In time, perhaps you and your companions came to be called heroes. Still, dark strands of fortune draw you onward to an unknown end.
	Until that end comes, you wander the world as a shadowy presence, turning up where you're least expected or most needed.

Some Beastlords remain apart from their beast companions, and they wander the cosmos in service to a higher entity or ideals. Others pass into the mists of death, as is natural, believing that they'll one day be reborn when the world has need. A few go on to attain a form of unity, in body and consciousness, as described here.
	Beastlord Apotheosis: When your final task is complete, you have proven that humanoid and beast are not separate. You and your companion act as a single being split into two bodies. Those who tell your story give an account of how the two of you illustrated this truth by becoming one. In fact, they whisper that what became apparent in the end was always so.
	You manifest a spirit that encompasses the values your beast companion symbolizes, and you merge with the beast exemplified by your nature. In so doing, you take the shape of a great spirit of nature, pristine and immortal. Your shape is thereafter as you wish it to be—person, beast, two at one time, or an amalgam thereof. Forever, you endure in the wild places of the world as a guardian and an inspiration. Perhaps you'll be an exarch of Melora, or you'll remain distinct from any deity, an example of a creature unique to the world.
	Those who follow your model hold you in mind when they travel and fight alongside their own beast companions. They, and others who revere nature and its creatures, look to you as an archetype and a guide. </specific>

With these treasures, you might have even saved the world you love. But even this seemingly perfect camaraderie, this example of flawless alliance, pales in comparison to your relationship with your beast companion.

Prove that your armor is like your skin, and your skin is like your armor. It can't slow you down; instead, it holds you up; Unbreakable, you carry each other into fable. Perhaps your armor even takes you to the side of a deity, such as Kord, who forever holds you up as an exarch of glorious and fearless battle. You then become the patron saint of all such warriors.
	Your name becomes synonymous with toughness and resilience. It develops into a word with which fighters compliment one another for bold exploits in heavy armor.

	You know that armor is more than just a piece of equipment. It's a second skin, and it's the face you show the world. You've made it a hallmark of your legend.

Lesser souls than you were overwhelmed by their study of the uncaring stars. Instead of commanding their own fate, they were transformed into mere pawns and cultists. With features shadowed under voluminous hoods, they toppled glare-eyed and drool-speckled into the clutch of mad entities. That is not to be your fate. You've divined a different truth in the cold pinpricks in night's endless void. Instead of pawn, you intend to be the master. You plan to have your force of will shine, burning forever. Unlike other stars that serve as windows, perhaps, to monstrous entities of an impossibly distant realm, your radiance is merely your own cognizance spreading ever outward.
	The unschooled believe a radiant one is nothing more than a servitor to the vast enigmatic creatures you court. True, others who have traveled your path have burned out, unleashing cataclysms that killed allies, corrupted monarchs, and even laid waste to kingdoms (and some whisper, previous ages of the world). You know these cautionary tales, and so forewarned you are forearmed should any of the powers from whom you draw your strength seek to suborn your will. Your allies have nothing to fear from you—if you are careful.

Some say that the souls of the greatest heroes are tied to the Prophecy, and that they cannot truly rest until their destiny is fulfilled. You are the vessel for such a spirit—a champion of the past reborn in an age that needs you. It's possible that you are truly the hero returned and that your body was somehow reconstituted or preserved. Dolurrh's Dawn is one example of how this could happen, but you could just as easily be a hero spirited away to Thelanis or bound in mysticslumber by Sora Teraza, whose true memory has only just returned. Alternatively, you could be a modern vessel for an ancient spirit. The Valenar elves have long claimed that a great hero could become an avatar for an even greater champion of the past; whether you are an elf channeling one of the warriors of Xen'drik or a paladin drawing on the soul of Tira Miron, you are living proof of this theory.
	As a reborn champion, your greatest strength is the skill that you possess. You might not have the raw might of a Demigod or the impossible luck of a Deadly Trickster, but your skills and heroism are the stuff of legend. You're not just a cutpurse, you're the greatest pickpocket history has ever known, and Thievery comes as easily to you as breathing. You might not possess the sheer spellpower of the Archmage, but you might know more about Arcana than anyone alive.
	Every reborn champion has a different destiny—a quest tied to your past. This is something you need to determine with the DM, but be sure to clearly tie it to known legends. For example, if you are the reborn champion of Tira Miron (founder of the modern church of the Silver Flame), you might need to defeat a great uprising of the demon Overlords. If you are the reborn champion of Galifar I, it might be your task to reunite the Five Nations under the banner of Galifar; if you are the reborn champion of Karrn the Conqueror, you might also want to unite the nations, but under the banner of Karrnath. A Valenar champion might seek vengeance against the dragons who destroyed all the nations of Xen'drik. A kalashtar reborn champion might be the key to transforming Dal Quor from a realm of nightmares to a place of light. Sometimes, you might not even know why you've returned. You're the greatest pickpocket in the history of Galifar, and your skills are the stuff of legends, but you never planned on saving the world. But the Prophecy has a plan for you—and it will take your nimble fingers to pluck the Ring of Deepest Shadows from the fingers of Erandis d'Vol when she seeks to claim the Throne of Endless Night. All that is certain is that this is a task that only you can accomplish—one so important that your spirit could not be allowed to pass on until it was done.
	Depending on whether you are truly the hero reborn or a spirit possessing a new body, the other people of the age might recognize your true nature. Being known as a reborn champion can be a blessing and a curse. Some people are quick to offer their allegiance, either out of respect for your ancient deeds or because they hope to be part of your new legend. But others might not be so helpful. Queen Aurala won't be happy to hear about the return of Kaius the Conqueror, and Cardinal Krozen might see a reborn Tira Miron as a threat to his own ambitions. Some might call you a fraud. Beyond this, the many stories about you ensure that your enemies know about your skills and talents; a successful DC 20 History check can provide a character with a clear rundown of your abilities.

Route to Immortality
Many Chosen can live for centuries. However, as a Chosen grows more powerful, the divine fire placed in his or her soul inevitably transfigures the mortal shell. When no vestige of the mortal life remains, it is time for the Chosen to ascend to the celestial court of his or her deity and champion the deity's cause in the immortal realms. No Chosen remains long in the mortal sphere once he or she has reached the  pinnacle of divinely sponsored power. </specific>

Your deity chooses you to serve as his or her proxy in mortal affairs. You protect your deity's worshipers, battle your deity's enemies, and champion your deity's causes. To suit you for this task, your deity breathes into your soul a spark of divine energy that grants you powers comparable to those of a demigod.
	As with the Demigod epic destiny detailed in the Player's Handbook, a divine spark increases all your powers. Unlike the Demigod, you are sworn to the service of a particular deity. While operating as an epic hero, you can function as a worldly exarch, receiving advice and commissions from your deity. Alternatively, you could be left on your own, advancing your deity's cause as you see fit.
	Not all deities have the power or the inclination to elevate a Chosen of their own. Some deities can elevate several Chosen at the same time, although this circumstance is quite rare. Deities most often seek out mortals who are especially faithful for this task, but a few gods seem to take pleasure in selecting undeserving or fickle mortals for their earthly agents. Those around you will probably refer to you using the name of your deity, calling you “the Chosen of Selûne” or “the Chosen of Moradin.”

Deadly Tricksters have to resist the temptation to take the dark path. Here's an example of how a campaign might present that choice.
	Travel by Crooked Paths: When you complete your final quest, your legendary reputation is assured. The stories of your convoluted exploits live forever.
	If you stand with your companions and see them through their final quest, embracing their cause as yours, you are acclaimed a true hero. You are acquitted of past transgressions, if any, and you are commended for conquering your erratic temperament when it counted most. You are invited into the realm of the entity you most admire and provided a palace, riches, true friends, and a legacy told and retold for a thousand years describing how the Deadly Trickster's changeable nature burned steady and pure in the finally tally.
	If, however, you betray your comrades and disrupt the completion of their final quest (or merely fail to aid them), you are cast out by all who once loved or trusted you. Your worst enemies welcome you to their courts as a newfound friend, and your name becomes a dark curse, forever despised by all who hear it. </specific>

As a Deadly Trickster, you might be a wanderer, thief, cheat, pragmatist, or survivor. Or you might be something stranger still—a hero. You delight in ever-stranger wonders, from the loftiest heights of the celestial spheres to the ash-strewn depths of the encircling chaos. As you take a firmer grasp on your destiny, you alternately scandalize, charm, upset, reward, and confound those around you.
	Some prophecies predict the Deadly Trickster will eventually betray his comrades and, in so doing, tumble princes, kingdoms, and perhaps even celestial realms. However, conflicting divinatory writs foretell the trickster's unexpected but vital aid, thus forestalling ultimate disaster and helping to create a new era of prosperity.
	Rogues and warlocks are the most likely characters to become Deadly Tricksters, but they have also appeared from the most unlikely of origins.

Maybe you're a free spirit who wants to experience everything the universe has to offer before tying yourself to a particular piece of the cosmos. You might be a rebel who hates the concept of having a singular destiny and therefore claims that you're not even interested in having a destiny. Or you may just want to avoid taking a side. Whatever the case, you're carving such a wide swath through events that your destiny will have no problem finding you when the time is right.

    <specific name="Immortality"> Exarch or Free Agent?
One or more gods might ask that you serve them as a probationary exarch while you work toward your own divine goals. You do not gain any additional abilities for accepting such a position, though you do gain access to a divine connection that might grant you information helpful for completing your quests. On the other hand, you might be required to perform tasks that delay your own goals, or even work at cross-purposes to your goals. No one said godhood would be easy, and acting as a free agent has its own problems as various astral beings take your measure.
Route to Immortality
At least one Demigod has chosen the path to ascension outlined below. Your own route to divinity might be different.
	Divine Ascension: When you complete your final quest, your divine nature yearns to complete your apotheosis. Upon ordering your mortal affairs, the astral flame smoldering within you detonates, consuming all that remains of your mortal flesh.
	The astral flame leaves behind a fledgling god, flush with the power only the truly divine can comprehend and wield. You ascend, blazing like the sunrise (or darkening the skies like an eclipse, if your inclinations run dark). Streaking into the Astral Sea, you are taken up into the realm of an established god who welcomes your strength. You join that god's pantheon and take on an aspect of the god's portfolio.
	Soon enough, your transcendent senses discern mortal prayers directed at you. </specific>

Your flesh becomes more than mortal and partakes of the divine vigor enjoyed by the gods themselves. Your epic-level companions are fast, strong, and smart, but you have the spark of godhood that sets you ever so slightly above all mortals.
	Deities from every plane eventually learn your name, your nature, and your goals. Some might monitor your progress to observe whether you possess the mettle of a true demigod, and a few could throw roadblocks in your path. It is in your hands to impress the lords of creation, or disappoint them.
	If you survive, overcome all challenges put before you, and reach the heights of ability achieved by few mortals, you are worthy to ascend to the ranks of the divine.

    <specific name="Immortality"> Immortality, of a Sort
Archmages are an idiosyncratic lot. There's no telling what choices the preeminent wizard of the age will make when he has completed his destiny. The following section details a path several Archmages have walked, but your path might vary.
	Arcane Seclusion: When you complete your final quest, you retreat from the world to give your full time and attention to the study of the ultimate arcane formula, the Demispell, whose hyperplanar existence encompasses all the lesser spells there ever were or ever will be.
	To aid your study, you build a sanctum sanctorum. At your option, your retreat provides you complete seclusion, and thus could take the form of a tower lost somewhere in the Elemental Chaos. However, you might desire to retain a tie to the world, and thus build a sanctum with a connection to the world. In such a case, you might found a new order of mages for which you serve as the rarely seen High Wizard. Alternatively, you might found a school of magic, for which you serve as the rarely seen headmaster.
	Regardless of your retreat's physical form or temporal connection, your contemplation of the arcanosphere persists. As the years flow onward, your study of the fundamental, deep structure of the cosmos removes you from the normal flow of time. Eventually your material shell fades as you merge into the Demispell itself.
	Thereafter, your name becomes tied to powerful spells and rituals used by lesser wizards. </specific>

Your lifelong perusal of grimoires, librams, tomes, and spellbooks has finally revealed the foundation of reality to you: Spells are each tiny portions of a larger arcane truth. Every spell is part of some far superior working, evoking just a minuscule fraction of that ultimate formula. As you continue your studies, you advance your mastery of spells so much that they begin to infuse your flesh, granting you a facility in their use undreamed of by lesser practitioners.
	You are often called to use your knowledge to defend the world from supernormal threats. Seeking ever greater enlightenment and the magical power that accompanies it, you are at times tempted by questionable relics, morally suspect spells, and ancient artifacts. Your destiny remains yours to choose—will you be archmage or archfiend?
