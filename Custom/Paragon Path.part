  You are intimately familiar with the power that comes with controlling your enemy's emotions. Fear is a good start, but you go even further, pushing fear into madness. You have chosen to draw upon the power of the aberrant creature that brings madness by its mere presence: the gibbering mouther. Your warcry carries the sound of a thousand voices, all shouting different things. Those who hear you claw at their ears, your voice infecting their thoughts and filling their hearts with terror.
  With this power comes a change. Your mind... is different, somehow. Some thoughts come only with difficulty, but at times, you know things that your friends and allies believe you had no way of knowing. You may sometimes try to share your unique viewpoint with others, but even your most innocuous comment brings pain.

  For those who wish to control their foes from a distance, there is no better totem creature than the beholder. Ocular adepts are seekers who wish to control everything they see. They possess minds bursting with energy, looking for release. The first and greatest expression of the link with your totem creature is the manifestation of a spiriteye.
  This weapon resembles nothing more than a ghostly eye which floats in front of the ocular adept. Despite its appearance, a seeker can use some of the principles learned with a mundane ranged weapons to fight with the spiriteye. It takes intense concentration and manipulation of the psionic and primal magics to create the spiriteye, but in time, the ocular adept gains mastery of the weapon and can control it with thought alone.
  Like the eye tyrant, you can make several swift attacks at range and float across the battlefield to a safer location. Attacks made with your spiriteye resemble the beholder's dreaded eye rays, and you have the same variety of effects with them (albeit with less control).

You have adapted your arcane talents to control the field of battle. Your tradition originated with gnomes of the Feydark, who escaped their fomorian masters by mastering shadow magic to make their innate talent for illusions even more potent. Like those gnomes, you are an illusionist at heart, building your tactics on deception and misdirection. The shadowstuff you infuse into your spells makes those illusions a tangible part of the battlefield.

The ancient order of the dark watchers was founded by arcanists who mastered the power of shadow, then matched that power with a righteous understanding of the light of life and the Astral Sea. As a dark watcher, you are a vigilant guardian of the light of life and the natural world. The power taught to you by the order grants you unmatched defensive prowess, allowing you to protect yourself and your allies from the forces of darkness. Only by embracing the shadow can its corruption be turned to light—or so you believe.

Through the art of the dusk oracle, you have learned to call forth the ephemeral shades of the dead to answer questions and help you battle your foes. Whether you are a character capable of tapping into these endless memories or an empathic mortal called upon by the gods, your search for knowledge is guided by the whispers of the dead.

You can step between this world and the world of shadow, summoning the aid of your nocturnal packmates from that shadow in times of need.

From time to time, the Raven Queen's gaze lingers on a mortal soul whose courage and devotion sparks her cold heart. To these mortals she sends a special boon—a raven-shaped shadow whose appearance is a sign of her favor.
	Those who gain this blessing are known as ravenkin, and from that point on they are never truly alone. The shadow raven that keeps them company is a physical connection to the god of death. Devout worshipers of the Raven Queen are the most common ravenkin. However, some ravenkin are recent converts to her faith, unsure of what they have done to warrant such a gift.
	Since the blessing that marked you as a ravenkin, you have been aware that you are watched by the Raven Queen. Some might grow uneasy under such scrutiny, but you embrace it, knowing that you have a special place in the god's plans.

Veiled masters are drawn primarily from the ranks of martial artists who have learned to perceive the world around them with little or no light. In keeping with your veiled master training, you prefer to attack from hiding, either striking from existing shadow or wrapping yourself in the gloom you learn to create. The features of the veiled master path reward those of a stealthy disposition, including monks, rogues, rangers, and other lightly armored warriors.

You delight in journeying to a previously unknown land, whether the journey is safe and quick or filled with peril. When danger draws near or when those around you are in need, you don't hesitate to spring into action, calling upon Avandra as your greatest ally. Regardless of the situation, you embrace life with unbridled confidence and optimism, and you accept the inevitable challenges you face with equanimity.

For centuries, the Oak Shields have guarded the wild areas of the world. Oak Shields, like their namesake trees, are known for longevity, hardiness, and loyalty. Legends claim that Melora personally trained the first members of the order, providing them with the secrets of using everspring groves and standing stones. Ancient sites such as these might hold information on how Melora's faithful can benefit from them.
	Each aspiring Oak Shield studies under a master. Together, the student and the master meditate beneath a sacred oak, seeking enlightenment about the natural world. The student learns to interpret the whispers of the primal spirits and to understand the wisdom of the changing seasons. During this time, he or she comes to appreciate when to stand tall against the wind and when to bend when the wind is too strong. In addition, the student learns about the complexity of the world, how something as simple as a tree can have multiple aspects to its nature. An Oak Shield applies these lessons to his or her life's work as a guardian of the natural order, remaining steadfast in the face of adversity and providing shelter during the storm.

Anyone can kill under the right circumstances. Every city boasts hundreds of people willing and able to do the deed, given the motivation. What differentiates you from other would-be killers is your consummate professionalism. You aren't deluded by a purported darkness deep in your heart or some religious obsession. You know your job and you do it well, without fuss, without mess. As a result, your employers return time and time again.
	All kinds of rogues and assassins become contract killers. They take to this path because it provides a steady revenue stream while indulging their talents and inclinations. Scoundrels from other classes adopt this profession once they determine that their consciences raise no objection.

You have nothing to fear from things you control. It's the things you can't control that can ruin you. As a demonologist, you know this lesson well. When you look into the eye of the Abyss, you have no doubt in your mind that you can learn to master it—one demon at a time, if need be.
	You have never shrunk from looking into shady places to serve your ambition. The longer you peer into darkness, the more certain you become that the secret to overwhelming power is hidden in the Abyss. 	
	As a consequence of your studies, you have gained the attention of a minor demon—a filthy quasit. Discussions with this companion have expanded your mind to grim new possibilities. At the same time, the lessons have dissipated any reservations that perhaps you have gone too far. The more you learn from this quasit, the greater the power you control. Thus far, you have blithely ignored a nagging suspicion that somehow things might go terribly wrong.

Having embraced the dark side of divine magic, you are now ready to delve deeper into the forbidden, to fully embrace the power offered by the dark forces of the cosmos. Only those who have committed evil are invited to study these black arts. Through the filthy deeds you have done and the wickedness in your heart, you have proven yourself worthy.
	Dabbling in occult mysteries carries a heavy price in body, mind, and soul. To harness the magic these entities offer, you must carve your f lesh with blasphemies. To understand the rites, you must push your mind to madness's brink. To prepare your soul, you must indulge in every evil, wallowing in the horror of it all.
	Where paladins fight for honor, good, and order, idols of darkness are treacherous, wicked, and capricious in their dealings. They kill for pleasure. They maim to learn from their victim's suffering. They never hesitate to feed their ambition and to grow their temporal power—they know that beyond the mortal coil lies only annihilation.

Eachthighern (pronounced "Whitehorn"), the Lord of Unicorns, is one of the most respected archfey in the Court of Stars. His wisdom is valued and respected by Queen Tiandra, and rival archfey such as Baba Yaga begrudgingly acknowledge his strength. Unlike most other archfey, Eachthighern takes mortal heroes as his personal knights and sends them forth to stamp out evil creatures wherever they are found.
	When Eachthighern needs a new knight, he sends a herald to one of his choices. These heralds are usually eladrin bards, but sometimes he assigns this duty to more exotic fey such as centaurs or unicorns. The herald transports the prospective knight to the Serene Glade, where Eachthighern makes his offer. If the person refuses the offer, Eachthighern is saddened but respects the candidate's wishes. The herald then takes the person back, but this former candidate loses the memories of the audience thanks to the use of a special type of oblivion moss. If the candidate accepts the offer, the Lord of Unicorns touches the person with his horn, in a manner similar to a king knighting a squire. If the newly accepted knight desires it, he or she receives Eachthighern's heraldic symbol of a unicorn rampant in a field of deep blue, but such displays aren't mandatory because Feywild natives instinctively recognize Lord Eachthighern's mark upon the knight.
	A White Horn knight's quests include anything from rescuing slaves from fomorian holds to guiding travelers safely through dangerous woodlands plagued by mad dryads, sly verbeeg, or ferocious owlbears. The knights count evil fey such as lamias and hags as their greatest opponents, because these creatures often hunt unicorns for their hearts and horns, which such dark fey use in their horrid rituals.
	A White Horn knight is blessed with some of the Lord of Unicorns' power and gains the service of a loyal unicorn steed. The knight's abilities mark the character as a valiant leader in the fight against evil. Though most White Horn knights pay ultimate homage to their lord, some also serve Corellon.

Among the archfey, few entities are more mysterious than the Maiden of the Moon. Elusive even to others of her kind, the Maiden of the Moon has only one apparent interest: removing the blight of lycanthropy, both from the Feywild and from the natural world. On the boundaries of the lycanthrope realm of Brokenstone Vale, some who have survived being ravaged by those creatures find inspiration from the Maiden of the Moon, taking up arms to hunt and slay the lycanthropes. In honor of the Maiden, they call themselves the moon hunters.
	Moon hunters are attuned to the power of the Feywild's moon, which is larger and brighter than the full moon in the natural world. They can channel its power to harm lycanthropes and other shapeshifting foes. In this manner, they are similar to the fey giants known as firbolgs. Like those hunters, they travel across the Feywild, calling forth auras of moonfire to reveal their enemies in the darkness. Once they find their prey, many use crescent-shaped blades to cut their foes down in a bloody harvest.
	In time, most moon hunters expand their hunt to include all creatures that take on another form to prey upon innocent folk, including rakshasas, doppelgangers, hags, oni, and lamias.

All realms see their share of swashbuckling types, whose love for freedom and a happy-go-lucky attitude belie their combat prowess. But the Feywild has given rise to a particularly exotic type of swashbuckler, whose fighting style defies gravity. These daring adventurers are known as soaring rakes.
	Soaring rakes gain their uncanny abilities through a variety of paths, though each has a profound link to the Feywild, either from being born in that realm or through a direct connection to one of the Feywild powers (such as being a fey pact warlock or having the Fey Bond feat). This connection to the Feywild and its ambient magic allows soaring rakes to take to the skies at will. Due to the added element of flight, soaring rakes develop a unique fighting style, and many consider them the ultimate skirmishers.
	Most soaring rakes have an outlook on life that mimics their abilities. Problems, dangers, and frustrations affect them less than most, since the rakes can take to the air and leave their worries behind them. In keeping with their carefree attitude, the vast majority of soaring rakes turn to Avandra for worship, trusting in the god of luck to see them through any challenge.

The darkness of the Abyss is a deep wound in the center of the Elemental Chaos,a bleak vortex that births the planes' myriad evils. Corruption flows out from this darkening pit to infect the land and creatures and twist them to evil. During your adventures, you encountered abyssal energy-perhaps when you slew a demon or after you explored a tainted site. The corruption changed you, infected you, and exposed you to horrid evil. Now it is all you can do to hold that evil at bay.

From brooding fortresses in the Elemental Chaos, the Doomguard watches the decay of the cosmos and its unstoppable slide into dissolution. These stoic warriors believe the universe's fate was sealed when the gods defeated the primordials, because imprisoning these entities kept them from sustaining the world and thus doomed it. The Doomlords are the Doomguard's champions, warriors aligned against those who espouse order and perpetuate corrupt and tyrannical regimes. As is true of their cousins, the Doomguard Marauders (Manual of the Planes), the ranks of the Doomlords include both valiant champions of freedom and murderous anarchists.

The most devoted students of the elements often withdraw from the society of fellow mortals to contemplate the deep truths of existence. You have chosen the lonely path of the elemental anchorite, dedicating yourself to a life of austerity and reflection. When your companions return to home, family, and high honors after their adventures, you instead seek solitude in places of great elemental power. The secrets of the universe are engraved in the stone of mighty mountains and whispered by the winds that sigh across lonely deserts.
	Some elemental anchorites seek isolation in order to master ever more formidable abilities, using elemental essence to further whatever purposes they deem important. Others are more philosophical, and view themselves as servants of balance who act to check the excesses of forces, monsters, or villains that disturb the natural equilibrium of the world. The purpose to which you put your understanding of elemental forces is ultimately up to you.

Your rapport with the elemental powers has grown to such a degree that they regard you as one of their own. Throughout the heroic tier, you established yourself as an able partner, ally, and, perhaps, servant of the elemental powers and in doing so earned greater and greater elemental rewards, including advanced arcane knowledge and more powerful spells. So armed, you stand ready to face even greater threats and reap even greater rewards.
	The elemental powers' favor grants you deeper insights into elemental magic. Not only can your gen servant fetch potent spells, but you can pierce the barriers between the planes to draw forth power to serve your needs. Such command over creation's fundamental forces translates into an improved gen servant that, at your command, can manifest the Elemental Chaos's unruly energies in effective and dangerous ways. Not only does your gen servant improve, but when you master all the elemental gifts, you can transform your servant into a powerful elemental monolith.

Many primordials lie unconscious in their bonds, but Vezzuvu, the Queen of the Burning Mountain, still harbors both awareness and reason. Vezzuvu long ago determined that her road to freedom was to win the devotion (or fear) of mortal followers, and thereby become an elemental god. She can no longer stride the world or reign over an elemental domain, but she can still shake the mortal world by exerting her will on places of elemental power or bestowing on others the ability to call upon her essence.
	As a herald of Vezzuvu, you have been gifted with a portion of the primordial's awesome abilities. You can wield this talent as you like, since Vezzuvu wants others who see your prowess to be drawn to her worship. The Queen of the Burning Mountain requires little from you most of the time, but her interests are erratic; you might walk the world for years without any messages from her, only to be sent suddenly to quell a volcanic rift, destroy the temple of an evil god, or seek out an artifact held by a frost titan.

For those who devote themselves to Nerull, the nature of the Reaper becomes clear. These few can access a shard of Pluton—-a domain of the restless dead unclaimed by the Raven Queen—and bend it to their will. For a true worshiper of Nerull, few higher rewards exist.
As a soul binder, you have bound a soul to your service. The soul might be that of an enemy whose torment you wish to prolong, a loved one whose company you wish to keep, or a friend whom you’re saving from a vile afterlife. Regardless of your reasons, the soul must protect and serve you.

Executioners who reach the paragon tier have proven themselves more than capable of carrying out assassinations (both clandestine and public) without being caught or killed themselves. For you, simple political assassinations and hired killings begin to lose their luster, because city watchmen or the bodyguards of local merchants rarely challenge your skills. Your abilities are better utilized stalking more powerful quarry—those that threaten the entire world, if not the planes themselves.

All across Kara-Tur, runepriests go from village to village teaching not only literacy, but also the lessons found in the Path of Enlightenment. Such selfless acts, in turn, bring these runepriests closer to their own enlightenment. Recognizing this truth, a few shan zi learn how to share their blessings with their comrades and allies, further pushing back the darkness so that the light of the Celestial Emperor can purge the world of ignorance and evil. The following paragon path is available to any honorable runepriest who strives to become the consummate leader, acting through his or her allies to vanquish the opposition.

From the time you first felt another's emotion, from the moment you experienced another's thought, you have struggled against the flood that threatens to drown out your identity. It seemed you would never grow comfortable with your strange talent and yet, against all odds, you did. You developed your concentration to drive back outside influences, but you still can't remember the last time you were alone in your head.
Training, focus, or natural adaptability has let you control the voices invading your thoughts. You can now single them out and use them to warn you of hidden dangers or to find ways around a foe's defenses. In effect, your supernatural senses give you cues to leading and fighting in battle

  Your mind is the gateway through which you imprint your will upon the world. In your studies, you have searched for more powerful ways of asserting that will. By choosing the mind flayer as your totem creature, you've gained some of the illithid's natural prowess at bending the wills of lesser beings.
  This connection has taught you hidden secrets of mental dominion, and you've found that they can also be applied to the shamanic practice of summoning spirit companions. In order to bind your new spirit companion to your will, you had to prove your dominance over it. Your spirit companion was cowed, to the point that it is more slave than friend. Even so, you know that if you let your guard down for a moment, the slave will try to become the master.

  You desired more fluidity of form and motion than what the masters taught you, so you reached out to a creature you knew would grant the abilities you seek. By claiming the chaos beast as your totem creature, you can take its form, and, in doing so, the form of any shape that its aberrant mind could imagine. Chaos beasts continually change form, and their strength comes from inflicting changes upon their unwilling foes. In taking their form, such as it is, you grow more powerful. Your body does not move like other creatures. You gain the upper hand by warping your limbs and contorting your joints in unnatural ways, leaving your enemies unable to predict your attacks.

In exchange, the clicking and skittering creatures serve your command, lending their power to your efforts in championing darkness.
	The vermin respond each time you wield primal magic. The more accustomed you are to these parasites, the more you learn to direct them in useful ways. Still, the cost to your body is severe. Forever more, your flesh bears the signs of the infestation you host.

  By the time you reach 11th level, your training in magic merges with your martial expertise. You can now shape arcane energy into useful attacks. Where other knights might choose the path of the stalwart knight, you find another road that leads you to perfecting your unusual style and defeating your enemies' expectations. 
  You might join the Sword Guard at the City of Starlight to hone your techniques, or you might go your own way, learning your techniques through trial and error. Regardless of how you come to these abilities, the result is a deadly fusion of magic and steel, until you become an eldritch knight who can withstand any foe.

You have fought myriad battles, each a contest to determine who was strongest, who was most worthy of the champion's mantle. You survived these battles through brute strength, speed, and toughness, but you always sensed something else, something truly monstrous, threatening to break free in the thick of battle. At one glorious point, your prowess grew mighty enough that the monster emerged. It burst through your self-control and transformed you into a raging killer. All finesse, planning, and moderation fell away. Only an unspeakable craving for blood and a terrible talent for producing it remained.
	Fighters are distinguished by a mastery at arms and the rigorous control they apply in desperate situations. Every warrior must come to terms with anger in combat, to channel it in useful ways lest he or she become ruled by it. To fail is to wind up dead, skewered on an enemy weapon.

Like many muls, you were born into slavery and, from your earliest childhood, endured brutal training for the arena or the armies of your noble house. For years you endured painful lessons, grueling conditioning, and the occasional lethal test of your skill until you became a killing machine. But despite everything that was done to you, your spirit remained free and unbroken. In time you left your owners' slave pens behind and set out to find your own fortune beneath the crimson sun.

Perhaps you are truly free, the master of your own fate after years of cruel bondage. Maybe you remain enslaved, but as a successful battle slave, you possess almost all the rights and luxuries of a wealthy free citizen. Whether you are a warrior who calls no one master or a prized champion who is a slave in name only, you carry the harsh lessons of your upbringing. Now it is your choice whether to fight for gold, for glory, for love, or for hate, but regardless of your motivation, you cannot escape the simple fact that fighting is what you do best.

In the city-states, some enslaved goliaths work as enforcers, and the other residents know better than to say no when half-giant thugs come looking for goods or money. The physical might of these thugs ensures that they receive better treatment than most slaves do, and sometimes their children are set free (to appease the parent and guarantee loyalty).

Whether you serve as a slave or seek your own livelihood as a mercenary, violence and intimidation are your most useful tools. You get what you want by using your size, your attitude, and your keen knowledge of the back streets and seedy locations of your city-state. Anyone who's heard of you clears the way for you to pass, and thanks to your stature, they always see you coming.

Some thri-kreen fully hone their natural physiology, turning their bodies into weapons deadlier than the gythka. They strengthen their extra arms for making claw attacks, practice graceful jumps with their powerful legs, and augment their natural venom so it is potent enough to take down tough prey. Because of their battle prowess, these kreen often become the strongest members of their packs. It is the thri-kreen way to challenge weaker leaders, and the greatest hunters rise to positions of leadership.

As you grow into the role of thri-kreen predator, you become larger and tougher, with thicker chitinous plates and stronger limbs. Along with these physical changes, your instincts and racial memories become more acute. You sense the long lineage of the kreen, and you understand the great hunts of the past and the long-forgotten tactics that let your race survive the most dangerous periods of Athasian history.

For some thri-kreen, these changes are natural—a hereditary gift. Others use psionic powers or martial training to strengthen themselves. Some find the predator's path after being exposed to sites or objects of power that stirred deep racial memories. No matter what triggered your transformation, you have become a kreen among kreen.

Throughout the Seven Cities of the Tyr Region, nobles surround themselves with retainers of good education, charming manners, and mastery of the arts. Many of these kept artists are just fops or decoration, but some are more than entertaining companions—they are skilled duelists and treasured advisors, deadly warriors never more than a few steps from their patron's side. In addition to beautifying the noble household with poetry and song, troubadours of this sort often serve as arms-instructors to young nobles and elite bodyguards trusted with the very lives of their patrons.
	Arms-troubadours are typically well educated, literate, skilled in an instrument or two, noteworthy poets, and equipped with aristocratic manners and refinement. Some begin as minor nobility attending wealthier and more important nobles, whereas others are descended from well-off merchants or commoners who set out to master the courtier's skills and seek out noble patronage. Most remain with a patron for a year or two before moving on, but others—especially those who come to be trusted as advisors and companions—might spend all their lives in a single noble's service.
	As an arms-troubadour, you might have a patron whose interests you look after during your adventures, or you could be between patrons. If so, given your fame and skill, your services might be very highly sought-after.

People in the Tyr Region learn not to trust a performer blindly. An ordinary minstrel, a graceful dancer, or a honey-voiced singer might well be a killer sent by a bitter rival. Custom demands, however, that no entertainer be refused entry. The household should welcome such a guest regardless of any suspicions. Nevertheless, paranoid nobles might turn away one of these entertainers for fear of poison in their drink or a knife in their back.
	Those who refuse entry to a performer do so at risk to themselves. Even if the new arrival did not have malicious intent, a refusal is an insult few performers can bear, and such an affront makes enemies where there were none before.
	An unwelcome guest is a talented entertainer who uses his or her performer's status to infiltrate a target's house and get close enough to make the kill. Unwelcome guests master the use of poisons, hiding venoms and toxins about their persons for easy access when the opportunity to kill presents itself. Some unwelcome guests work alone, but many claim membership in an entertainer's troupe, an organization often rife with murderers, thieves, and saboteurs. Bards make the best unwelcome guests, but rogues, fighters, and assassins might find something in this path for themselves as well.

Caravans are the vital links in the chains of commerce binding outposts of civilization together across the wild wastelands of Athas. They come in many different forms from place to place—long files of slave porters, pack trains of heavily laden crodlus and kanks, wagons drawn by snorting inixes, and of course the towering mekillot-drawn argosy wagons that are wooden fortresses on wheels. Regardless of the beasts of burden or the goods carried, caravans are crucial to maintaining Athasian civilization. Not only do they carry valuable goods from one city to the next, they also carry rumors and tales of doings all across the Tyr Region to people thirsty for news of other places, provide travelers with the opportunity to surround themselves with the safety of numbers, and feed scores of desert outposts and settlements with a steady stream of food and supplies.
	Leading a successful caravan is no mean feat. Disaster in a hundred guises waits in the desert—hungry monsters, savage raiders, ruthless competitors, scourging sandstorms, unreliable wells, mutinous drivers, and the possibility that the goods turn out to be worth less than one paid for them when they reach market. From day to day, a caravan master might have to lead the guards and drivers in battle, search out a new path when a familiar road is buried in the shifting sands, bribe greedy officials, or enforce brutal discipline on a rebellious underling. It takes a rare combination of character judgment, business acumen, and physical courage—attributes you've cultivated for years. On the open desert, you are the master of your fate, and you wouldn't have it any other way.

A merchant house has power and influence, soldiers and workers, but everything the house is depends on its representatives' efforts. The shady dealer represents one breed of dune trader, a skilled and treacherous agent specializing in intrigue and manipulation. Some shady dealers work as independent speculators and others act on a larger house's behalf. They still travel as dune traders, shepherding goods to places in need, but they always have an ulterior motive, seeking some rumor or bit of gossip to benefit themselves or their house.
	The image you cultivate masks a devious mind and a propensity for doing whatever you must to survive. Your skills at negotiation and intrigue serve you well: they let you confuse enemies and lure them into traps where your allies can strike. In time, your words and movements make fools of everyone you meet.

On Athas, the rarest and most honored primal casters are those who evoke the spirits of elemental water. Healers of unmatched skill and bestowers of the blessed rains, they are held in reverence and awe by the common folk. Even vicious raiders and the cruelest slavers hesitate to harm or obstruct a rain priest, understanding that one who follows the rainbringer's path might very well save their lives someday by calling the rains to a parched desert or granting the gift of healing.
	You are one of these rare healers. Like many elemental priests, you are no friend to the sorcerer-kings, or any other defilers. The sorcerer-kings resent any who wield magic outside their own control, and you can expect to be watched closely by templars—or even arrested—if you are careless about revealing your powers. However, the people of the desert and the poor commoners of the cities revere your gifts and often go to great lengths to help you against the sorcerer-kings, the templars, and their informants.
	Although many rain-servants are pacifists, you are under no particular obligation to avoid violence or to bestow your healing on those who are not worthy of it. Sometimes the lesser harm lies in destroying a creature that otherwise would go on to inflict greater harm on others—or, in the case of defilers, on the world itself.

A number of cults, sects, and secret societies devote themselves to the mighty elemental spirits of Athas. The priests of the Smoking Crown are one such sect. They are servants of the great fire-spirit dwelling in the Smoking Crown, the largest volcano on known Athas; by extension they are servants of volcanic spirits everywhere in the world.
	As a Smoking Crown initiate, you are one of the elite members of the priesthood. You carry a large burn scar on your chest, face, or hand as the sign of your allegiance. You are under no one's orders, nor do you command any lesser priests—all Smoking Crown priests are free to serve as they see fit. Many are wandering fire-scarred lunatics shouting wild prophecies in the wastes, but others are highly effective assassins, champions, and revolutionaries (you likely fall in the latter group). The only member of the priesthood with any special authority is the Keeper of the Smoking Temple, who guards a shrine hidden in the fiery depths of the mountain. Most Smoking Crown priests give aid and protection to other members of the sect when needed.
	The Smoking Crown is large and active by the standards of most elemental sects. Initiates travel widely throughout the Tyr Region, teaching people to respect the elemental spirits, exposing iniquity, and defending the weak against the depredations of the strong. Most of the Smoking Crown's wrath is directed in particular at Hamanu of Urik, because of the damage Urik's miners have inflicted in the obsidian quarries of the Smoking Crown.

The people need heroes. They need brave individuals to show them that adversity can be overcome no matter how tough the opposition. They need to witness battle to slake their thirst for blood, to vent their frustration and anger about their own lives. They need gladiators, for these bold warriors give them all they need and more.

You are the champion the people demand. You might have come from humble roots, having grown up as a slave or a criminal, or you could be a professional who chose this dangerous life for glory and coin. Regardless, something about you and your courage resonates with the people, and you become more than just another warrior fighting for your life in the pit. You are their hero.

Just as the sun breaks the horizon, sending lambent waves washing across the countryside, the stands fill with eager spectators, pushing and shoving for the best view to the stage where the day's dramas will unfold. Suddenly, a half-dozen warriors explode from the gladiator gates. They flip and spin, their bone and obsidian blades flashing in the morning light. The crowd roars with delight, welcoming the jazst troupe to the city once more.
	Suddenly, a grating sound breaks through the cheers as a heavy gate lifts. The ground trembles, quieting the audience. The jazsts feign concern with exaggerated expressions, calling out to the crowd for aid. The beast gate yawns wide, birthing a ferocious creature, its horny carapace fitted with blades to catch and slash. It looses a thunderous roar as it charges. Before it can connect, the dancers scatter, tumbling away in a dazzling display that leaves the beast confused, blood streaming from a dozen cuts it never saw land.
	You have mastered the cruel techniques of the dangerous performers known as the jazst dancers. Unmatched in their skill with the blade, they weave a deadly dance on the arena floor, tumbling and capering as they deliver rapid-fire cuts and slashes to weaken and confuse their opponents. Your skills only improve in time, eclipsing those masters who first taught you as you became the greatest in the Seven Cities. Like your fellows, you draw out your fights, repeatedly springing into danger to impart a painful injury before slipping away.

In the interest of protecting the city-states, the sorcerer-kings allow noble families to keep small armies of slave soldiers. Frequently, they use these soldiers to take action against other nobles or to protect their property. A sorcerer-king can, of course, call upon the nobles' soldiers to fight for his or her interests. And it's best to follow the sorcerer-king's commands.
	As one of your duties to your family, you were given charge of a legion of slave soldiers. You trained with them, developing your psionic talents so you could command them silently. (Though sometimes shouted commands and threats can intimidate your enemies far better than eerie silence.) The most skilled mind generals can keep up a continuous mental link, sharing sights and combat instincts with all the troops in the legion.

Psionic power has an infinite number of uses, but few people on Athas develop more than a passing familiarity with their innate talents. Within the psionic schools of the city-states, or with private tutors, noble children are expected to hone their psionic powers. As with any type of study, most students don't put forth much effort, and therefore don't learn much. The average noble retains the barest vestiges of psionic training, just enough to overhear gossip from a distance or to telekinetically move a cup a few inches.
	While your peers shirked their studies and neglected their psionic gifts, you devoured every piece of lore and technique you could. Fascinated by the capabilities of the mind, you practiced constantly and delved deep into the secrets of the Way. Every time you outmatched another student with your gifts, every time you tricked someone into giving you what you wanted, you felt a thrill you couldn't find anywhere else. The world and your society reward the most cunning and the strongest, and you live up to those ideals.

There is no greater calling than to protect the land, to shelter it from those who would exploit it for the power it contains. Your long associations with the spirit world revealed to you the fragile balance that allows life to continue despite the hardships. Only if this balance is maintained can life and the world recover, and so you make this your work, devoting your life to its protection.
	The primal spirits are not blind to your sacrifice, and they respond to your efforts by lending aid where and when they can. Whenever you choose a land to guard, the spirits emerge from the broken landscape to add their strength to your own. They slow enemies as they approach and punish the trespassers.
	As your bond with the land grows, so too does your understanding of its power. You can draw primal magic into yourself when you assume bestial forms, growing your strength and vitality. Within your guarded sites you can move from place to place, ensuring that nothing under your stewardship comes to harm. And if you face a dire threat, you can call forth the ancient spirits to harry and kill any you name as your enemy.

The primal spirits all bear scars from the ancient conflict that led to the world's devastation. Many vanished, consumed by destructive magic. Those who remained either retreated to the few remaining havens or turned to elemental power to sustain themselves in the bitter aftermath. It is to the ravaged, the broken, and corrupted that you turn to wage your war against tyranny and right the world's course once more. You give voice to their grievances, guiding their wrath to destroy the enemy you have vowed to fight.
	You have become the ally of these twisted primal spirits, who allow you to wield not only their strength but their very essence in your crusade against the despoilers. The spirits answer your commands, lending both primal and elemental power to your attacks. Their anger lets you drive your enemies to turn on one another, while at the same time sheltering your allies from harm or infusing them with elemental strength. The spirits are vengeful, and you are that vengeance personified. The most revealing aspect to your heightened connection is the ability to bind your spirit with your enemies, so that even as your companions close, your spirit rends the soul within.

Through a combination of personal talent, family connections, wealth, and loyal service to Dictator Andropinis, you have won a high office among the templars of Balic. Most praetors are magistrates, overseers of commerce, or military commanders—they lack your personal might and are simply high-ranking officials and administrators. You, however, aren't saddled with mundane duties. Instead, you are a personal representative of the dictator, vested with the power to further the interests of the state in whatever manner you deem appropriate. As a badge of your special office, you are entitled to wear a cloak or tunic with a purple stripe or border.
	As a praetor legate, you might spy on Balic's enemies, investigate corruption, look after the defense of the life-sustaining trade routes throughout the Forked Tongue, track down criminals, or search for ancient artifacts in ruined cities. You answer only to Andropinis himself . . . and if you are a true patriot, you might find that the interests of the dictator and the interests of Balic are not always one and the same.
	Balic is friendlier to trade than any other city in the Tyr Region is, and several important merchant houses are based here. Consequently, praetors find that their duties often lead them to distant villages and even other cities, watching over Balic's trade affairs. Most praetor legates are natives of Balic, but capable and trustworthy foreigners occasionally rise high in the ranks of Andropinis's templars.

The lowly and the ignorant see defilers as craven and corrupt—little more than thieves with magical talent. It's true that the defiler's path is selfish in its way: A defiler requires energy from associates and the living world nearby to power his or her greatest spells. And it is also true is that defiling can corrupt the body and mind. But only a fool could fail to see the power that defiling offers, and you are not a fool.
Most who openly defile enjoy the protection of high station or powerful patrons. Perhaps you are of noble birth, and your family's wealth protects you from the consequences of your actions. You might have been chosen for an arcane education while still young and tutored in the ways of magic by templar instructors, or perhaps you gained the king's sanction by other means—as a reward for some great service to the king or the city, through bribery, or by the manipulation of powerful nobles or senior templars exercising the king's favor. If you are not a native of a city-state, the only sanction you require is sheer power: You can defile freely if your tribe protects you, or if you are so powerful that no one dares to challenge you.
If you are one of a sorcerer-king's sanctioned defilers, you might be expected to make yourself available for special tasks or duties as needed. Such assignments are rare, however; most sorcerer-kings allow master defilers in their cities to do more or less as they wish, trusting that they won't jeopardize the city or themselves. After all, master defilers are universally loathed, and if anything ever happens to the king, even a master defiler wouldn't last a day.

For most arcane spellcasters, the urge to defile is an ever-present temptation that whispers deep in their souls. The unseen life energy of plants and animals nearby sings with power as a spell is shaped, a ripe fruit waiting to be plucked and savored. Far too many spellcasters see no reason to resist, and they eagerly rip away the life essence to fuel their magic, but those who choose the preserver's path carefully shape their spells around this fragile aura, drawing a little energy from many different places, and never so much that the life that it emanates from is harmed or extinguished.
	In this delicate give-and-take of spellcasting, the master preserver is an arcanist who has developed a perfect sense for the balance of destruction and power. Whereas other casters struggle to maintain their discipline and must consciously control their impulse to drink too deeply of the fragile energy around them, the master preserver's self-control, experience, and intuitive grasp of the subtle currents at play allow him to instantly shape his spells without fear of defiling. In fact, the master preserver's skill and precision are so great that he can often match the raw power of the most reckless defilers without harming a single blade of grass.
	When you choose the master preserver's path, you turn your back on defiling forever. From that day forward, the whispers of temptation hold no more power over you. But in exchange, your sacrifices have led you to a place where you need to give less to perform your magic; the world now gives you a little back. If this situation isn't confirmation of your path's integrity, what else could be?

Preservers of the Veiled Alliance lead the way for spellcasters everywhere, keeping the only honorable path of arcane power alive. And yet as powerful as they are, most of them need stalwart warriors to hold back the enemy while they work their magic. Protecting preservers is a duty of all who consider themselves members of the Veiled Alliance.
	You have taken this tenet to heart and become its embodiment. Involvement with preservers has taught you much. Your training with the Alliance has honed your skills so that you can disable any adversary. This practice might have even made you into a preserver proper, if you weren't one before.
	Now you are an elite defender of the Alliance and its goals, an ideal example of the preserving way. You weave arcane power to give your allies the openings they need. So that you and your allies can succeed, you hinder the enemy with specialized techniques. Victory is sometimes defined as mere survival or a daring escape, but preventing enemies of the Alliance from doing harm or making their own getaway is even better. Few do that better than you.

The endless deserts, shattered mountains, and broken landscape are home to more than just rubble and debris. Life survives despite the challenges, as proven by the desert snakes, the dune mice, the scrabbling lizards, the burgeoning cacti, and more. As the nomadic tribes well know, life might be easier in some ways in the city-states, but it's not impossible in the wastelands if you know what to look for and what to do. Yet there are greater secrets than these guarded by the land's spirits. Through long sojourns in the deserted places of the world and years of studying the land's mysteries, you have acquired the skills needed to subsist in the most barren environments. No land, no matter how desolate, poses so great a danger as to bar your passage.
	As a dune strider, you are the living embodiment of wanderlust. The dust of a dozen cities and villages lies under your sandals; from the Ringing Mountains to the Sea of Silt, from the Endless Sand Dunes to the Road of Fire, you mean to take in all the splendors of Athas in good time. You witness the world from a unique perspective, seeing its beauty as well as its desolation, believing the possibility that the wrongs done to it can one day be righted. The land's spirits offer you their power to aid in this restoration and help you to punish those who worsen the world and bring it ever closer to annihilation.

The deserts of Athas are breeding grounds for raiders, brigands, and bloodthirsty savages of all kinds. In a world where it takes backbreaking labor to scratch out a living from the dusty soil and countless people live under the shadow of famine and starvation, many creatures find it easier to get what they need by taking it from others. Most sand reavers operate in small bands, since large tribes can't support themselves on the slim pickings of the deserts. Other reavers move from band to band and region to region, seeking out the easiest prey and most reliable companions they can find. Life among the marauding tribes is often brutal and short; the day a warrior fails to keep up with the march or take his next meal from the tribe's latest victim is the day he is left behind, abandoned to his fate.
	As a sand reaver, you are a wolf of the wilderness, a lean and hungry predator. You are familiar with the harsh laws of the desert bands and always ready to react to sudden violence—or begin it, if need be. You are regarded as an outlaw and an enemy to all civilized creatures, and your life is forfeit in any city-state you enter if you are identified for who and what you are. The best of your kind are outlaws with a glimmer of purpose and a rough code of honor, sworn to protect each other and to steal only from those who have goods to spare. The worst are rabid jhakars and ragged kestrekels without a single redeeming virtue. Where you fall on this scale is, of course, up to you.
	Whether you chose a life in the desert or found it forced on you, your experiences leave you changed. Your softness, mercy, and empathy are gone, and in their place is only ruthless determination. But your struggles leave you stronger, tougher, and better able to withstand any difficulty you encounter. Above all, you are a survivor, and the wastes are your home.

Practitioners of the Way form connections between their minds and bodies that allow them to go beyond their physical limits. Wilders with strong inborn talents have the strongest connection, and hurting such an individual causes his or her psionic power to flare even brighter. Some wilders have returned after being exiled to the desert, walking tall when they should be nothing but piles of picked-clean bones. Others have become notorious for their battle prowess, taking on wave after wave of enemies and dispatching each more viciously than the last.
	As your foes attack, your mind surges and you feel your muscles and senses burn with new strength. With every cut and bruise you suffer, more power rushes over you, making your mind more dangerous and protecting or healing your damaged body.

The desperate conditions on Athas call for desperate measures. Wielders of the Way use slivers cut from their own minds to strengthen their armaments.The exchange is worth its price, since it lets them disorient and destroy their foes. They can always reclaim the mental fragments, though some wielders of the Way consider certain emotions to be liabilities and believe life runs smoother without those feelings cluttering their minds.
	You entrust the wild, untamed parts of yourself to your weapon, mentally fracturing your personality and reinforcing your weapon—whether it's an obsidian sword, a bone axe, or a rock warhammer—with that emotion. Though you still have a faint connection to that piece of your mind (at least enough to replace it later), you do have difficulty expressing the emotion associated with that fragment. Your allies find you inscrutable, wondering how you can fight with such ferocity while keeping a placid demeanor, or why your expressions and speech seem calm while you're pursuing stronger and stronger foes.

Ameth's closest friend and advisor, Sot-Olmat, pioneered a discipline of rigorous mastery over the elements within a genasi. It is a discipline that one can master through a combination of meditation on a simple mantra and a series of exercises that look harmless but serve to unlock elemental potential within the genasi. The mantra is a repetition in Primordial regarding one's elemental affinity: Fire cannot be chained, or Water cannot be chained. Some manifestations require the mantra be changed: Earth is not chained; earth is the chain. Acid consumes all chains. Sot-Olmat developed this path while a slave, and he continues to expose himself to danger to teach the rudiments of it to other enslaved genasi.
	A genasi who studies this discipline becomes impossible to bind or cage. He or she can escape bonds of all sorts swiftly, becoming a master of escape artistry through the mastery of the elemental nature innate to every genasi.

At 11th level, your redeemed deva takes on the dark star paragon path. Freeing oneself from corruption is no guarantee against returning to evil, and no one knows this better than does the fallen deva. Reclaiming your deva form does nothing to dispel those memories and experiences from your time as rakshasa. The wicked memories lurk in your thoughts, urging you to indulge in deviant acts, to embrace vice and wickedness, and to succumb to evil's temptation once more.
    Your dark memories haunt you. Try as you might, you cannot silence the voices nor can you suppress the experiences you found in your fallen state. As you were once able, you can still call upon the memories you carry to aid you, but in addition to the other deva lifetimes, you also can draw upon your time as rakshasa as well. Drawing from these recollections places you at risk of falling once more, but provided you remain fixed toward your path, perhaps one day you will overcome the shame you must shoulder.
    Devas know their redeemed brethren as dark stars, so named for their new ascendancy toward virtue and also for the evil shadowing their souls. Devas are, of course, rare in the world and so dark stars are even rarer-so scarce most might believe them representative of the entire race. As a dark star, you must ever contend with your unpleasant memories while working to earn the redemption you have received.

At 11th level, your veilwalker deva takes on the heavenly deceiver paragon path. You walk just this side of a boundary thinner than the finest veil and develop an affinity for the deceptive magic of the rakshasa even as the memories of past incarnations become distant. You choose your path to take advantage of this power and wield it against evil; or perhaps you are on a path dictated by your carelessness because the intentionally evil would already be beyond redemption. You bear patterns on your skin distinct from those on most devas. The colors are always darker and include more red than their incorruptible brethren. The patterns made by the colorations are sharper, more sudden, and more violent than the simple elegance of other devas.
    The longer you remain a veilwalker, the greater a command over illusion and deceit that balancing act grants you. Manipulation of others becomes an art and a second nature to you.

Lolth's return and a resumption of the disastrous war that nearly shattered the elven peoples cast a terrible shadow across Corellon's priesthood. Anticipating this event, the elders formed the Azure Guard who would one day serve as the principle leaders in repelling Lolth's demonic forces. The warriors combine prayers to Corellon with secret arcane spells to achieve the edge they need to overcome their enemies. Azure Guard members do not advertise their special status lest they invite assassins to strike at them. One cannot join the Azure Guard without invitation, and even those called to serve in its esteemed ranks may find themselves unequal to the demands the training makes.

Your purpose has become clear. You see it in the desolation around you, in the ruins scattered across the countryside, in every agonized face you behold. The wind carries it with the stench of carrion, smoke, and fire.

You might choose to take on powers from a second class in place of a paragon path. If you have the Novice Power, Acolyte Power, and Adept Power feats for a class, you can choose to continue to gain powers from that class rather than take a paragon path. If you choose this option, you gain several benefits.
    At 11th level, you can choose to replace one of your at-will powers with an at-will power from your second class.
    In place of the paragon path encounter power gained at 11th level, you can select any encounter power of 7th level or lower from your second class.
    In place of the paragon path utility power gained at 12th level, you can select any utility power of 10th level or lower from your second class.
    In place of the paragon path daily power gained at 20th level, you can select any daily power of 19th level or lower from your second class.
    Psionic Augmentation: If either of your classes has the Psionic Augmentation class feature and you choose paragon multiclassing, the benefits you gain at 11th level are different from those noted above.
    If your first and second classes both have the Psionic Augmentation class feature, at 11th level you gain 2 power points and an at-will attack power of 7th level or lower from your second class.
    If your first class has the Psionic Augmentation class feature and your second class doesn't have it, at 11th level you gain an at-will attack power from your second class as well as an encounter attack power of 7th level or lower from that class.
    If your first class doesn't have the Psionic Augmentation class feature and your second class does have it, at 11th level you lose one at-will attack power from your first class but gain 2 power points and an at-will attack power of 7th level or lower from your second class.

Arcane magic demands much of those who would master it. It consumes time and attention. A disciplined mind is needed to bend raw energy into useful spells. Many arcane users find that the power they attain through this pursuit is sufficient: its rewards are great and the secrets unlocked are astonishing. A taste of power leads some to look beyond their dusty tomes and ritual circles to turn their power toward temporal gains. Arcanists prove capable, if not devastating, in battle, and those who dabble in leadership, commanding servants and powers beyond comprehension, prove to be some of the deadliest warlords of all.
	Marrying power drawn from your pact with the martial techniques used by a warlord, you become a commanding presence on the battlefield. You twist your spells to confound your enemies while helping allies attain the best positions they can to meet the battle's demands. Even when your foes thwart your clever plans, you have a knack for finding solutions to the thorniest problems.

Tactics have their place. A cunning stratagem can give you and your fellows a decisive advantage in the opening forays, but slavish adherence to plans invites disaster. Circumstances change, and when they do, the best response is to do something your enemy would never expect.
	You stand between two worlds. You have the knowledge and training of a field commander, but your military expertise is ever at odds with your reckless manner. You might devise some plan but abandon it quickly, giving in to your bloodlust and rage when circumstances change. When you do, your allies find your wrath infectious, the frenzy overtaking common sense as they smash through their opponents.
	The most powerful warpath berserkers come from bravura warlords and thaneborn barbarians. Wrath burns within you, seething in your heart. Yet you can master this anger and bend it to incite your allies to find new courage and strength. Those nearest you feel your wrath and make it their own, and the longer they fight alongside you, the more intense their outbursts become.

Faith is a powerful ally in battle, but sometimes it is not enough. Religious leaders may demonstrate incomparable knowledge of heavenly matters, but such lore is of little use when battling on a bloodsoaked field. Divine servants who find themselves embroiled in grinding battles or drawn into vicious wars over matters of doctrine or politics may turn to secular leaders to command their armies. While any general friendly to the temple will serve, most prefer allies who share their beliefs and uphold their doctrines. Finding such an individual ensures loyalty to the righteous cause and reaffirms the temple's role in the lives of those recruited to fight on its behalf.
	You may have come to this path through an uncommon devotion to one or more gods or served as a divine champion until your faith transcended your capability and drove you to master tactics and warfare. You are a warrior of the heavens. You lead your companions into battle with righteousness, with your sword and faith as your shield. You are a beacon in combat, reminding your comrades of the worthiness of your cause and strengthening their dedication to see it to its end.
	The sainted general is especially useful to inspiring warlords and protecting paladins. You can still fill the defender role if you're a paladin, but the path features and powers make you a strong team player. If you stay close to your companions, you can provide a steady supply of divine power to augment their attacks and to scorch your enemies with heavenly fire.

You have seen more battles than you can count. The clash of weapon against armor, the bitter screams of dying soldiers, the creaking of saddle leather, all of this and more are as much a part of you as the blood in your veins and the heart that pumps it. No training could prepare you for the atrocities you witness. No drill simulates the life and death struggle between enemies. You may have learned the fundamentals from your mentor, but the battlefield was your true instructor.
	You combine tactical genius with practical application, blending your talent for maneuver with your mastery over fighting techniques and weaponry. You lead from the front, charge into battle, and smash through your enemies. You can direct your allies to positions where they can be most effective. Those who fight on your side learn much from your techniques, and by following your example are better able to respond to the enemies arrayed against you.
	The battle champion paragon path is best suited to tactical warlords and guardian fighters. Your path features improve your allies' performance, giving them a powerful edge when using action points and the ability to match your attacks when you spend an action point. Your powers work best when you are engaged with an enemy while allies are nearby.

Power alone is not reason to rule. One should earn obedience and loyalty, not force or buy it. The people need to understand that slavery serves no one. It is merely the strong stealing from the weak, and while that might suit the odious scavengers that sup on dusty carrion in the deserts, it's no way for people to live. They need someone to pull the veil from their eyes and break the bonds that restrict their thinking. Even the slaves need someone to show them they can be free. They need inspiration. They need an example—someone like an escaped slave.
	You are a rarity in Athas: You believe in freedom. You fight not just for yourself but for others. Anyone who seeks to escape the master's whip deserves your help—as long as they don't wish to turn the lash upon others. The slave masters, the corrupt nobles, the rich merchants, and the sorcerer-kings—they have the power, but slaves outnumber free people ten to one, and that means the odds are in freedom's favor.

A foulborn's life is a difficult one, and no one knows this better than you. You have carried the Far Realm's burden within you for more years than you can count. You long ago came to terms with your corruption, adapting to the unsightly transformation you were forced to endure. In doing so, you discovered ways to make the curse work for you. Many years spent testing your capabilities revealed unexpected advantages that help you exceed your normal limitations, enabling you not only to survive but to thrive.
	Reflection and understanding do not come without a price, however. The more you draw on your corrupted power, the greater its effect on you and the more unhinged your mind becomes. This state of being lends itself to strange delusions and compulsions, but the power you gain is worth it. When you fully come into your legacy, you learn to share your gift with others, causing them to undergo transformations that wrack the body and mind.

The Awakening opened your mind to new possibilities, aiding you in the acquisition and use of psionics. To achieve your present power, you sacrificed the body to which you were born. But even though the replacement contains none of the flaws of that first vessel, this new form is no longer suitable to hold the perfection that is your mind. The power you have gained over the course of your adventures is working to reshape you once again.
	The body that is the temple of your psionic power grows ever more resilient. You respond to the worst injuries by steeling yourself in preparation for more. Hunger and thirst become dim memories as your need for such crude nourishment passes. You find sleep unnecessary, outgrowing this last lingering connection to your mortal life. The physical perfection of your new form serves your mind at the highest level. You are the living incarnation of psionic power, and your body now reflects your mastery of that power.

Without form and order, all life reverts to its natural state of chaos. Without thought, there can be no life, and you prove this maxim by creating life from the power of thought. You are the master of summoning, shaping the raw possibility of your psionic power into whatever form you desire. The servants you fashion are granted a semblance of life, which they sacrifice willingly to fight on your behalf. Your creations are many and varied. Your focus allows you to bestow a consistent range of traits that mark them all as your children, and that grant unequalled usefulness on the battlefield.

The elemental flame and arcane fire can be devastating on the battlefield, but the power of the psionic fire you wield is more deadly by far. You can scorch your enemies or scour them from the inside out. You cloak yourself in flames to protect yourself from foes as you lash them with your fiery touch.

Others of your kind shape reality as a potter works clay, but creating and reforming your environment has little appeal to you. Instead, your knowledge of the underlying patterns in the structure of the objects and creatures that make up the world around you that allows you to test and sunder that structure.
	The raw stuff of life and matter are yours to toy with. Your power comes at a price, however. With each bond you break, the structure of reality is weakened to some small degree. Your work is minor compared to the ravages of time and the power of gods, immortals, and the Far Realm. But all things are connected, and your power might be the catalyst that unleashes destruction on the world.

A covert clan of enigmatic monks engage in assassination, espionage, and sabotage. They are mercenaries, taking commissions from the powerful or the vengeful. Members of the Unseen Hand are bound to the order for life, the clan's mysteries are too sensitive to allow any member to withdraw or resign.
	Secrecy and subtlety lie at the heart of your training. As long as your enemies cannot identify your purpose, you have them at a disadvantage. You might achieve this subterfuge through cunning disguises, skulking through shadows, or misdirection. Mastering the higher mysteries helps you manipulate darkness, leap across vast distances, and penetrate your enemies' minds.
	Being a trained killer is not so different from being any other kind of warrior, but you must ensure that your tactics and techniques do not alarm your companions. At the same time, you must maintain friendly relations with the Unseen Hand clan or face ostracism, retribution or worse.

The mystics of transcendent perfection believe the mortal body is a faulty receptacle that prevents them from attaining a higher form. They strive to overcome the body's limitations and attain their true potential. Just as importantly, they believe that they must foster reason and enlightenment, and help others transcend the body to embrace a state of harmonious existence.
	By following the transcendent path, you learn to overcome your physical limitations by solving the riddles of past masters. Each conundrum you unravel opens your mind to greater possibilities. You first learn to shape your words to encourage behavior and alter impressions, to move without interference, or to deny movement to those who oppose you. You learn to close wounds and vanquish ailments with a touch. Upon mastering the techniques of transcendent perfection, you can deny your enemies' attacks by elevating your consciousness above pain and despair.

The tiger claw style is an ancient, honored path. Its practitioners have incorporated techniques from different traditions, but the style retains a central feature: the tiger claw. A practitioner curls his or her fingers toward the palm to make a claw. Through iron discipline, the monk transforms each digit into a rigid talon capable of raking and rending.
	Mastering tiger claw maneuvers builds your strength and hardiness, and your strikes shred enemies. You spring at your foes with astounding speed. With true mastery, you take on the characteristics of the celestial tiger. Coarse orange and white striped fur covers your body. Your hands become clawed paws and a tiger's visage replaces your features. With great green orbs for eyes and a mouth filled with sharp teeth, you embody the tiger claw style.

The basilisk is renowned for its hunting prowess, and its pitiless gaze. Inspired by both the basilisk's sinuous movements and the immobilizing effect of its gaze, a group of monks have developed disciplines that mirror this creature's fearsome reputation.
	Your study of the basilisk's fury has opened your mind to the emotions around and in you. Achieving this state empties your body of thought and draws the sensations of others through your eyes. Foes that peer into your obsidian gaze are drained of hope. All that remains for your enemy are apathy, stasis, and death.

You haven't been through Hell. Not yet.
	Ever since you joined the Circle of Smoke and Whispers, the Hells have been trying to work through you instead. With countless painstaking maneuvers, through endless waves of vicious engagements, you have driven them back each time. If even a fraction of your sacrifices were known, they would move the most hardened veteran to tears. Secrecy is part of the price you pay to do what you do so well. You don't claim the honor of your victories or boast of your accomplishments; you can't mourn for fallen friends either or pay the tribute due them. Only the Circle of Smoke and Whispers knows your worth and your burdens. In the world you've sworn to protect, through the people who depend on you, you walk unseen and anonymous.
	In this you emulate generations of your predecessors. You have studied and mastered the tenets that grant your success. You watch from the background, strike from the shadows, and disappear without a trace after you eliminate a threat. The Vigil remains; you keep it. Thanks to your dedication, a safer and brighter day will dawn soon.
	When you've been through Hell, though, the world will know it.

Whether they wander for love of maps and food, a search for truth, a lust for treasure or adventure, or a noble quest, their wandering is aided by the lessons they learn from other travelers.
	As a student of the Falling Needle practice and an itinerant, your techniques aid you—typically when others decide to attack you. You move swiftly on the road and in the heat of combat. You might be struck, but you do not remain in place for a second blow.

Hidden pathways and secret portals riddle the world and the planes. You possess the keen eye and open mind that let you pick out these shortcuts and exploit them. Your understanding of planar mechanics might be instinctive, originating in an unusual knack for sensing and locating such anomalies. It might be the result of extensive training, in which you learned from a master unbound nomad how to circumvent the bounds of reality. However you came by your knowledge, you can travel unseen byways with ease.
	As an unbound nomad, you are rarely in one place for long. You use your talent to slip through the cracks in the world around you, then reappear wherever you want. You can dodge through new gateways to escape a persistent enemy, or force your foes into the unseen spaces between the planes. Your unpredictability leaves your enemies confused, chasing after phantoms as you take charge of the battlefield around them.

Since the Talaric Codex was first compiled to record the fighting techniques used against the horrors of the Far Realm, fragments from that lost tome have been scattered far and wide. Although the warrior society that conceived the codex is no more, their workings live on in the champions who have stumbled across these ancient writings and mastered their secrets.
	During your travels, you have come across fragments of the lost codex. The full meaning of these scraps of lore escaped you at first. In time, however, you put the pieces together to master the lessons they contained. Although others might draw different conclusions, you have learned that life is an essential struggle between the natural world and the Far Realm. Whenever the madness of the Outside pushes into ordered reality, the natural world responds with violence. With your unique talents, you have come to embody the world's wrath.
	From the teachings of the Talaric Codex, you turn your mind's eye inward to search out flaws and vulnerabilities. When you discover a gap in your defenses, you allocate your psionic resources to reinforce it against attack. Your extensive study also rewards you with increased clarity and focus in combat, allowing you to devastate your foes. By neutralizing opponents when they strike, you endure past the point when other warriors would fall.

Your philosophy of life and battle is shaped by your belief in the infinite storm. In every corner of the world and every part of the planes, order and chaos contend for domination. Violent storms of elemental fury are the most potent sign of this struggle. At no time is all the cosmos ever at peace. Through study and diligence, you draw power from these infinite and endless storms, channeling their destructive fury. You represent the infinite storm in your travels, welcoming the violence that is a constant part of life. Like the power of the storm, you are everywhere.

Your mind rejects all notions of what is possible and impossible on the battlefield. Psionic energy flows through you, imbuing you with an irrepressible need to move. You flow around your enemies, blurring past them before they can land a blow. As you move, your attacks slip through your enemies' defenses with deadly effect. You goad a foe into following you, then wrack its mind and body as it gives futile chase.
	You are quicksilver in living form, moving with such speed and grace that your enemies have no hope of pinning you down. Whether you fight alone or in the company of others who also race through the heat of battle, your enemies name you the quicksilver demon, never knowing where you will strike next.

Strange dreams are common among those who wield psionics. Your dreams, however, are different. You dream of a black monolith set within a cavern rimed with ice. This vision has haunted you for as long as you can remember, but until now, you have struggled in vain to discover its meaning.
	The blackstone monolith has chosen you as its champion. In another age, noble champions of a distant land fought to contain a breach to the Far Realm. They sealed the rift with powerful psionic wards, behind elemental stone imbued with their own consciousness. Each generation, the wards they forged must be resealed by new champions. You are bound to the fate of the guardians you follow.

Not all vampires are undead, drinking the blood of the living or draining souls with a touch. Some feast on intense feelings such as fear and love, anger and happiness. They are insidious creatures—parasites that gorge without drawing attention to themselves. Some might not even realize what they're doing. Regardless of whether a siphon is cognizant of his or her abilities, the effect of such a character's power is palpable, as a victim falls into the clutches of lethargy, becoming torpid and drained.
	As a siphon, you use psionics to absorb thought energy from your victims, drinking deep from their emotions and feelings to increase your power. Your mind is a vortex, catching others' thoughts and using them to replenish your resources and overcome your injuries. Once you establish a link with another creature, you can draw its energy until your prey is drained and unable to act. You might keep this energy for yourself or transfer it to your allies so that they can share its benefits.

You can sense when another enemy might close on you, shifting your position to best receive the attack. The thoughts you steal help guide your attacks and keep you from harm, letting you endure in combat to destroy the enemies standing against you.

Mortals might be flawed creations, given to error and misjudgment. But all mortals are blessed with a singular gift: the soul. Psionic energy revealed your soul's power, and through long study and introspection, you learned to navigate the labyrinthine pathways of your being.
	This energy suffuses you and surrounds you in a radiant glow. Although you can dampen your inner light, you and others around you find its presence comforting. In time, the light responds to your commands, burning your enemies while bolstering your allies, or even allowing your soul to eclipse your body.
	The more you access your soul's power, the more you understand that this essence must be guarded. Those who would exploit souls, twisting them for dark ends, and those who would hoard souls on their journey beyond the body must be destroyed and their prisoners freed. To this end, you commit yourself against the myriad villains who use or abuse souls.

Although knowledge and training are great virtues, sometimes such expertise acts as a barrier. Knowledge can breed complacency, blinding an individual to a better path. As an individual specializes, time spent gaining a deeper understanding of the chosen specialty is time not used to expand his or her knowledge in other areas. Too much focus can narrow the vision.
	Rather than bind yourself to one pursuit and one belief, you expand your mind and reject your assumptions. In doing so, you find new possibilities to explore. The lessons you learn help you overcome different challenges and hardships, and they allow you to adapt to whatever situation you face.
	The liberation you enjoy can also extend to your companions. Reaching into their minds, you stir their true selves, shaking them free from the expectations that bind them. No doubts or fears hold them back. They are free to strive harder and to push past limitations their expertise places on them. You are their catalyst, and with a mere mental touch, you effect a transformation to help them become what they were meant to be.

Incursions from the Far Realm have left scars across the world throughout the ages, so that the material fabric of the mortal realm is riddled with holes and fault lines. Your psionic power has made you sensitive to the damage caused by the aberrant invasion, and it has given you a talent for using that damage to your own advantage.
	The memories come to you in dreams and waking visions, instructing you in forgotten fighting techniques to better combat the invasion from the Outside. These revelations also grant you a unique perspective on the world, allowing you to seek hidden pathways through time and space. Through these unseen scars of ancient battles, you move from place to place in a flash and can open portals through which you scatter your enemies across the battlefield. The more destruction caused by the threat of the Far Realm, the more powerful you become. Most importantly, this knowledge also tells you that the aberrant menace will one day be defeated.

As your psionic talent matures, you find yourself focusing on the disparate nature of the disciplines you master. Focusing your thought on the edge of unpredictability in your training, you discover the latent chaos flowing through your magic. Through trial and error, you learned to master the chaos latent within your powers and unleash it against your enemies. Drawing on the power of chaos can be dangerous, but you are up to any risk you might face.

When you trace the path of your ancestry, it inevitably leads to one place: the Labyrinth City of Leng. That mighty dominion of minotaur power destroyed itself centuries ago, becoming a tangled ruin haunted by demons, bestial minotaurs, and the mad spirits of those who slaughtered one another during the city's final convulsions.
	All the evidence you've discovered leads to one inescapable truth: You are heir to the Iron Crown of Leng. Your ancestor was the last to sit upon the Blood Throne. You live today because someone of your clan fled the fall of that terrible city.
	That thought alone would be a heavy burden to bear, but you hide another secret. One of your ancestors is with you—in spirit at least. You hear his gruff voice goading you to conquer and to let your enemies' blood fall to the ground. The ancestor also incessantly demands that you seek out the lost Iron Crown. Sometimes you see his furious eyes glaring from beneath his horned brow.
	You think you have only one way to be rid of him: You must find the crown, work your way to the heart of the Labyrinth City, and enthrone yourself as Lord of Leng. But maybe no spirit exists. Maybe the ghost is a symptom of a madness you inherited from the rulers of the past. Perhaps, like the Labyrinth City, you are doomed to demented savagery, haunted by dreams of the past.

The ability to affect others with supernatural draconic fear changes the way a dragonborn sees the world. Dragonborn are already proud, and seeing other creatures flinch and cringe before him or her only swells that pride. Pleased by others' reactions, they learn how to focus the dragonfear they wield. They hone it into a weapon and force enemies to their knees, tears streaming from their faces in terror. It is an exhilarating feeling that the best fear walkers learn to control.
	Your mastery of others' fear is still growing, but it is already formidable. When you choose, you make enemies grovel at your feet, and you've found few you cannot make fear for their lives with choice words and a threatening stance. Soon, you will achieve the same skill with this ability that the dragons themselves wield.

You dream of leaves shining in the sun, giving you the strength of ten. You dream of roots burrowing into the earth, providing unyielding support. You dream of towering over your foes as tree looks down on undergrowth. Then you open your eyes and smile, because it is no dream.
	You have embraced your origins and have learned the trick of manifesting a strength few others can hope to match, either in raw power or in size. You reach for this strength as a guardian of living things everywhere, be they plants or animals, as well as humanoids who've learned to live in harmony with nature.
	For those who can't learn coexistence, you have nothing but disdain. If their crimes are severe enough, you act swiftly, showing the enemies of life the error of their ways.

The history of pyromancy parallels the history of all magic among the mortal races. As soon as they first dabbled in the arcane, primitive wizards sought to apply that power to one of the most intimidating and important natural forces of their experience: fire. They learned rudimentary spellcraft under the difficult tutelage of flame, and their experiments became the foundation for almost every subsequent study.

Ironically, pyromancy's lessened popularity indicates its importance. It remains so fundamental that many wizards take it for granted, relegating it to their perceived inferiors. Common presumptions reveal the truth, however: Tales of wizardry nearly always include at least one fireball.

As a Master of Flame, you embrace this ancient discipline without regard for anyone's disdain. You will show them true mastery of magic as you devastate opponents with the force they overlook.

You exemplify the virtues of Erathis. In life, you abide by and enforce the laws of your people. You have defended your home against myriad creeping evils and brought light to the dark places in the world. In battle, you know you are only as powerful as the warriors who fight beside you, and you strive to guide them to victory just as fervently as you take up a weapon. Erathis has taken special notice of your devotion and your prowess, and she has blessed you with a powerful touch of her golden light.

To be a gatekeeper of the golden palace, as you are, one does not need a specific power source or skill set. One needs only to value the lives of their allies as strongly as their own, and to know that it is more important for an arrow to strike its target than it is to be the one who fires the arrow. With your allies at your side and Erathis in your heart, you intend to litter the battlefield with fallen enemies—even if you never lift a sword.

A small faction of tieflings views the world through a veil of decay that shrouds the ugly and the beautiful alike with the appearance of death and rot. Some seek ways to minimize the influence of these visions on their lives. Other blightseers embrace the knowledge that the gaze of ruin grants them. They study the appearance of a thing as it is now and as it is in its ruined state, and over time they learn to read their visions for meanings about the present. The destruction they see serves as a constant source of omens about creatures' fates and instructions on how to bring about those fates.

Through ardent research, you have developed a catalogue of what your visions mean. How you act on this knowledge depends on your goals. The information is yours to use as a superlative assassin or as a way to avert terrible fates.

Your body is an arrangement of inert matter infested with your consciousness. But the spark of your soul is just one part of a much vaster being. Yes, that entity is destroyed and its mind is splintered . . . but if you focus on the shards that make up your form, you can begin to hear the susurrus of a thousand, or perhaps even a thousand thousand other shardmind consciousnesses somewhere “out there.”

With a little more concentration, you can tap into this fantastic network of your fellows and use it to hypercharge your own cognition. You can gain a limited ability to predict the immediate future. You can channel the output of all those minds to enhance your attacks. Sometimes you have the ability to borrow the abilities from other shardminds.

When you manage a particularly clear connection, at times you can predict the future so well that you exploit a foe's momentary weakness.

All this extra mind power comes at a price; you can get caught up experiencing shadow glimpses from the lives of countless other shardminds. But occasional fugue states do not concern you; they are the price you must pay as you tap the detritus of a mind that might have once equaled a god's cognition.

The Living Gate, the first best defense against the horror of the Far Realm, is gone, dissolved into thousands of disparate crystal shards. A disaster, certainly, but you are keenly aware of the upside; some of those shards make up your body and some quanta of the original animating consciousness of the Living Gate makes up your mind.

Aside from the obvious benefit of your own existence, it should also be clear that you are composed of the physical manifestation of a straightforward concept, which fundamentally is about controlling access through a threshold.

Whether others call a feature a gate, a door, or an entry doesn't matter; all that matters is that you can conceive of a particular area as a threshold. Once you've got that fixed in your mind, your body viscerally responds, granting you ever greater abilities to open or close a way, to monitor a passage, to ward off foes, and to keep your allies safe.

Walking unseen among a thankless populace are agents of the Unbroken Circle—a unity of avengers in service to the goddess Erathis. Each agent is sworn to root out and destroy forces that foul the goodness of mortal hearts. They wage a constant war against growing evil, defending civilization and the honor of Nerath from the closing jaws of tyranny and corruption.

As an agent of the Unbroken Circle, you take on corruption wherever you find it—and since you actively look for it, you find a great deal of it. Whether you're based in a population center and spend most of your time there or travel far afield in search of those who have fallen morally and ethically, you rely on your skills as an avenger and the ones you gain as an agent to handle combat situations and provide support to those with whom you travel. Due to your constant vigilance for signs of corruption, you have found few you can trust, and you always formulate an escape plan in every situation, just in case the ones you rely upon fail you.

Although many wardens acknowledge the All-Spirit in name, you welcome the All-Spirit into the very core of your being, transforming yourself into the strong right hand of the All-Spirit and seeking to bring the truth of the All-Spirit to bear in everything you do.

Becoming a scion of the All-Spirit is a transformative experience that shapes you in myriad ways. You shrug off the seemingly inconsequential minutiae of your mortal existence in favor of embracing the greater spirit that subsumes all creation. Although you still exist in corporeal form, you develop a spiritual communion with the All-Spirit that reshapes your essence and combines your soul with the greatest primal spirit. You are a pure representative of the All-Spirit, seeking to protect the natural world by channeling the power you have been granted by the All-Spirit.

Covenant agents are elite killers who are trained to deal precision strikes against enemies of their god with little to no detection. As a loyal member of your chosen deity, you have already learned skills that make you a prime candidate for taking on the mantle of covenant agent. How you got to this point varies and is based on your religion's structure (or lack thereof ), and what goals you accomplish in the name of your god can also vary greatly from any other covenant agent's goals.

You already know how to kill. It's not a question of skill in that area, nor does anyone question your commitment to kill when needed. Now, however, you are fully invested in being a weapon used by your chosen deity. You spend countless hours honing your skills in stealth, subterfuge, and unconventional stratagem, plus you must tend to your normal commitments to your religious patron and maintain whatever façade you have chosen. Your path is one of secrecy—none outside your religious organization should learn of your ties to it. This can place pressures on you that those with whom you travel do not understand. As far as they know, you are what you choose to present to them, whether that's a light-hearted adventurer seeking treasure or a stoic combat veteran who just happens to know a few extremely effective ways to deal with those seeking your blood.

You are a horrific and awe-inspiring sight on any battlefield. When working in mercenary units as a means to shatter an enemy's defensive line, you and your fellow juggernauts use a combination of brute strength and cunning tactics to crush anything in your path. Many armies have seen their shield-lines falter under the crushing cascade of goliath juggernauts and many commanders have come to fear your presence in any conflict.

However, your unpredictable methods makes you a controversial addition to the rosters of any army. No one can tell what will happen when you enter the fray, and you've discovered that some commanders prefer to avoid using your skills altogether due to your rumored capriciousness. However, this purported impulsiveness has a purpose: If your foe can't anticipate your next move, you are more likely to succeed at your chosen task.

When you choose the life of an adventurer, whatever your reasons for doing so, you use your knowledge of tactics to become a truly efficient part of the team with which you journey. In combat, you prefer to place yourself in the middle of the fray so that you can cause as much chaos as possible in as short a period as is required. However, you don't position yourself in this manner consistently enough to become predictable. Also, you are not without wits. Many discount your ability to anticipate your foe's maneuvering and tactics, which can cause them to underestimate you and ultimately lead you to success.

You have proven yourself to the Sharakim and are a full blademaster of the order. It has not been an easy path, but you have found a balance between your instincts and the rules of the society in which you live. You have trained in etiquette so that you are, at the least, competent in such matters, but you are not afraid to unleash your inner savage when it serves you better. In either case, your words demand that listeners pay you heed.

In battle, you are continually in motion. Each step flows another strike against a foe, and when you explode into action, all enemies around you can feel the pain. Even in the middle of your battle fury, you work to protect your allies, drawing a foe's attention to you with every blow.

You grew up in a tribe that valued speed in battle, to the point that none would wear any armor heavier than a leather vest, or perhaps a hide cuirass. When you came of age, you saw the downsides of this strategy. Swift warriors found that their enemies' blades were just a little swifter. You challenged the orthodoxy of the tribe, favoring heavier and heavier armor. Your tribe mocked you, for with your protection, you found you could no longer keep up with the rest of the tribe in battle and would inevitably fall behind your comrades as they claimed glory. Some murmured that you wore the armor so that you would not have to fight and risk your life.

You would not be known as a coward, so you went on a pilgrimage in honor of your deity. You wanted to prove your bravery and seek an answer to your problem—the balance of defense and agility. When you reached your goal, tired and worn, you did not ask the gods for answers: You demanded them. You had shown your strength and proven your courage. A blessing from the gods was the only just reward for your exploits. A storm raged about you, and as you finished your demands, lightning struck you. Many gods would have killed you for your effrontery, but perhaps you pleased your patron with your attitude. You awoke later, unharmed, and you knew your prayers were answered.

Many of your tribe had already written you off as dead when you began your pilgrimage, and they were astounded to see you return. You would not tell them what happened, preferring once again to prove yourself through your deeds. When next the tribe went into battle, they were surprised as you kept speed with the other warriors, and amazed when you fell upon your enemies, your every blow ringing out with the power of the storm.

You are compelled to seek out and destroy those unworthies who thwart—by intent or by accident—the will of your patron. Your deity has tasked you to hunt down these infidels and see them brought to justice, and you do so with implacable zeal. You remain vigilant for signs of enemies of your faith. When you find them, you follow the will of your deity to the letter, bringing these foes to their knees. You tolerate no deviations from your course, whether brought about by others or by what some would call extenuating circumstances. Your half-orc heritage provides you with physical strength to handle those who might oppose your efforts to judge others as well as with mental fortitude to follow through on the task at hand.

Your god has taught you that strength hidden is strength lost. When battle must be joined, you let your foes know that you stand in judgment of them, displaying your power unflinchingly. When you call them out, they know that their time is at hand. You will carry out the sentence that you levied against them, and when they fall, you know that your god smiles upon your efforts.

Under the cloak of night, tyrants and murderers grow restless. They sense an intent gaze upon them, like a bird of prey circling in for the kill. Sometimes this unease is enough to discourage despicable acts. But far too often, a more direct course of action needs to be taken, and the silvered head of an arrow puts down evil.

The Arrows of the Moonbow are a scattered sect of sworn brothers and sisters who dedicate their lives to ensuring that each mortal has a fair chance at writing his or her own destiny and changing his or her own stars. The Arrows travel far and wide, seeking no reward but that which they confiscate from the corpses of their targets. All sorts of divine heroes work among their ranks but, regardless of inclination, they all come to favor subterfuge, trickery and, above all, stealth.

For some scoundrels, the ability to convince and deceive by using language is insufficient. They want to fool the eyes, not just the ears; they want to find far more reliable means of tricking those who would stand against them.

Some of these, such as you, choose to dabble in magic. Either through training or innate talent, you have mastered the art of illusion, and you combine that with your own wits and rapier-sharp tongue to build a repertoire of perfect deception.

You have a trick that none of your enemies expect you to have. It has come in handy time and again, making you wonder what other skills you might learn to further confound your foes.

You begin by practicing your trick to make it more powerful and even faster to perform. Eventually, you realize that your allies provide instruction in a variety of ways. Some might call what you do imitation, but that barely scratches the surface of the relationship you have with your allies. You can become one of your allies, if only for a moment, and use his or her power as your own.

Millennia ago, when the dwarves fought for their freedom from the giants, a pair of champions arose. Twin brothers Gildur and Toris Irontop fought fiercely and bravely, crying out to Moradin with each victory. They seemed unstoppable . . . until they came up against Durandus, “the Iron King.” Their axes could not nick his stony hide, and their hammers cracked against him. In the end, Gildur fled into the mountains with his grievously wounded brother on his back, praying to Moradin for guidance.

That night, both brothers had a vision of when Moradin first forged the dwarves from iron, bedrock, and diamonds. Each gained understanding of the Soulforge's power; Toris used its white fire to strengthen his body and soul, and Gildur used it to forge a hammer that could smash through iron like glass. When they battled Durandus a second time, both of their weapons glowed white with the heat of the Forge, burning, cutting, and crushing Durandus until he was no more.

After their victory, the brothers gathered the most pious followers of Moradin and taught them what they had learned. These devotees formed the first generation of the Soulforged knighthood, which has spent thousands of years mastering the white fire, and using it to protect Moradin's followers.

Both legend and conventional wisdom suggest that dwarves first developed the style of fighting that exchanged a weapon for an extra shield. Being stalwart by nature, they appreciated a tactic that might favor those who stand fast. Being stubborn by nature, they vigorously pursued something counterintuitive until they made it work.

The other races only experimented with the testudo style as tales of the dwarf testudos' exploits began to spread. Today, members of all races can become testudos, but all still study the teachings of those first dwarf masters.

As a snapping testudo you exchange some of your damage potential for extreme defense and greater control of the battlefield. With your awe-inspiring shields and savvy, you force your enemies to fight where you want them to fight, and then cripple them whether or not they oblige.

One of most ancient of shamanistic practices focuses on the river of renewal, an ancient, all-encompassing flow of spiritual energy that protects living things and allows them to heal. Tribal elders invoke the river of renewal to cleanse plagues, grow crops destroyed by pestilence, and help close the wounds of war. No sickness exists that this powerful energy cannot cure. Many shamans who strive to end suffering and bring healing to their people seek to be bathed in the spirits of the river.

As a scion of renewal, you invoke spirits from the river to cleanse your allies. Through your power, the body's natural healing is accelerated, making it able to better fight off diseases and effects of a natural and magical nature. You can call on the spirits of the river to strike at your foes, leaving behind an aura of healing for your allies. Your spirit companion becomes a fount of spiritual energy from the river of renewal, taking on a watery appearance as it provides a neverending supply of pure energy to bolster those around it.

At the core of every creature lies the animating spirit that gives life or mobility, called the animus. The shaman sees the animus in the spirit world as one of the most fundamental forces required for life. Therefore, striking at or manipulating this spirit is akin to changing the very fiber of a creature's being, turning a huge advantage into the weakness that brings about your enemy's downfall.

A shaman who walks the path of the animus predator has a simple philosophy: When you see no weakness, create one. By manipulating the animus, you make your foes weak to your allies' attacks. You strip away resistances and immunities, leaving your target open to devastating blows. You give your companions the perfect weapon to bring true devastation to your enemies.

Legend tells of a great spiritual storm that forms the center of the natural world. This great, eternal upheaval represents the power and feral nature of the primal world. Spirits of the great wind ebb and flow around spirits of rain and thunder as aspects of lightning streak and flash in an eternal, chaotic mass. The chaos inherent in the great storm is equal only to the power that lies within it.

Only a powerful shaman can take up the mantle of the stormcaller. You can bring temporary order to the great storm and bend its power to your will. You call forth lightning spirits to empower your companions. You summon primal rains and wind to batter and bewilder your foes, while sheltering your allies and allowing them to move around the battlefield effortlessly. Your close ties to the great storm grant you and your allies protection from nature's fury.

The essence of fire is the essence of potential. Even the smallest flame can become a raging conflagration, capable of consuming everything in its path. Fire is an unstoppable force unmatched by almost anything else in the primal world. Likewise, the spirit of flame has the capability to consume everything it touches, growing with and reshaping the world around it. However, every fire spirit starts small; only with fuel can it grow.

As a soul igniter, you imbue the physical being with fiery spirits, providing a limitless supply of fuel for these powerful forces. This imbued spirit is called Soulfire, and it allows your allies to move at the speed of a raging wildfire while enhancing their blows with burning spiritual flames. As you grow in power, your spirit companion also becomes a stronger conduit for the spirit of flame, capable of unleashing scorching fury at your enemies.

Some mithral dragons are content to spend their lives in the Astral Sea, having no connection to the world or the business of mortal creatures. That is not true of the Mithral Pentad, a band of five mithral dragons who believe it is Io's will to rid the world of the tyranny wrought by their chromatic brethren. The Pentad seeks to eradicate any nation controlled by evil dragons, but they also strive to wipe out individual chromatics and their hoards to prevent any future injustice. Rarely, a metallic dragon might have vile plans that indicate its evil, but the Pentad seeks to convert them to the will of Io before killing them outright. If they refused to be turned, however, then the life of a copper or a mercury dragon is as forfeit as a red or black.

Although the five ancients of the Pentad are powerful, they cannot be in all places at once, and they seldom exhibit their full might on the battlefield. They have established an order of mortals to seek out and destroy lesser drakes, or band together an army to assault heavily fortified fortresses or even nations. This organization is called the Mithral Arms, because they labor to accomplish the will of the Pentad, and each member is infused with the power of their patrons. Riches, power, and influence mean nothing to a Mithral Arm, unless such means can directly aid the destruction of evil chromatic dragons. Woe to all who stand in the Mithral Arms' way, because they carry the power of the Pentad with them.

Dragonborn can be a harsh and taciturn race. When a dragonborn becomes known for excessive jesting or practical jokes, he or she is shunned and called glee-born or “touched by copper.” Rather than accept scorn, glee-born embrace their fun-loving nature and welcome the title with pride, even if they are forced into exile away from dragonborn lands. Luckily, many human kings welcome glee-born into their courts as jesters or courtesans.

Glee-born are quick to laugh, but they can be dangerous in battle. A sly word or cutting insult can easily distract a foe, and glee-born are known to have arcane talents that they use liberally in combat.

Only true copper dragons could match the sly wit of a glee-born, and many scholars posit that the gleeborn must have coppers in their lineage. Indeed, the scales of older glee-born have been known to develop an orange hue and even a green verdigris tinge late in life. If they live long enough, that is.

The Great Teacher was revered by all the peoples of his underground realm. The ancient adamantine dragon's influence didn't spread into the land of sun and wind, but in the rock, ore, and fungus of the Underdark, his benevolence erected an island of good under the earth. Long ago, the Great Teacher rescued a group of dragonborn that that were beset by denizens of the Underdark, and instead of returning to the surface, these dragonborn devoted themselves to the Adamantine. They became his Adamant Instructors and together they forged a noble nation around the Great Teacher's hoard in the cavern complex they called Adamanth. The dragonborn prospered under the Teacher's guidance, and Adamanth became a haven for all that was good and strong. Even some drow and duergar were drawn by the Great Teacher's benevolence to renounce their darker ways and live in peace under the rule of the Adamant Instructors.

Then one day the Great Teacher departed Adamanth to deal with a nasty group of purple dragons that were slaughtering his people on the borders of his influence. He never returned. For decades, the Adamant Instructors have followed the Great Teacher's instructions, which were carved on a disk of solid adamantine in flowing draconic script by the ancient dragon before he departed. But the Adamant Instructors are hard-pressed to keep hope alive in Adamanth. Purple worms continue to assail them, the drow are assembling an army, and rumors say that mind flayers are stirring in the deep caves to the west. In the absence of the Great Teacher, it is up to the Adamant Instructors to lead the adamantine dragon's people through these dark times.

The House of Methys has always had a strong connection to quicksilver. As the story goes, the family fortune was forged from a source of mercury discovered in one of their iron mines, with the wizards and alchemists of the realm paying handsomely for the rare liquid metal. At some point, though, rumors spread that by digging for more mercury, the House of Methys awoke something powerful in the deeps. Then, the rumors abruptly stopped, possibly because anyone heard prying into the details about the noble house died soon after.

What most folk don't know is that a clan of twelve mercury dragons served as the source of the Methys fortune. The merchant house drained them of some of their blood, which can be transformed through ritual magic to pure mercury, and then sold the metal to the highest bidder. At first, these mercury dragons were amused that humans would pay so handsomely for their blood, and their hoards grew at the cost of a minute or two of pain. But when they learned that Methys agents had stolen a clutch of a mercury dragon's eggs to harvest for the precious liquid metal, they realized the scope of the Methys family's hunger for power. These twelve mercury dragons, maddened
with grief, turned on their business partners and slaughtered the leaders, then used their polymorph ability to assume their identities. Now the Methys dragons have made it their mission to reacquire all of the mercury that came from the dragon eggs by tracking down the sales of the blood using the spotty records the Methys agents kept, plus ensure that knowledge of the ritual used to transform their blood is erased from the world. They have vowed to never again allow another agency to profit from their own blood.

To help them in this endeavor, they turned to group of dragonborn agents, gathered one by one. Soon after the original members of House Methys were dispatched, the twelve dragons discovered that by infusing their blood into that of a dragonborn, through a painful ritual colloquially called the Infusion, the dragonborn gained some abilities that benefited them in their pursuit of their masters' goal. The mercurial assassins, as these dragonborn are known, are then sent out to hunt down every drop of mercury created from the foul ritual and bring it back to House Methys. They are also charged with tracking down any copies of the ritual that might exist. Assassinating those individuals who have some portion of the mercury isn't a primary objective, but it isn't exactly frowned upon either. The mercurial assassin is rewarded no matter the circumstances.

High atop the mountains in Hoar Frost Castle, the mighty Sephitherax trains an elite corps of dragonborn so that they can defend the innocent. Honorable and decent people respect the Argentum Alliance, and the unscrupulous and corrupt fear it. All flights of chromatic dragons dread the justice of the Alliance, but the white dragons especially seek the destruction of Hoar Frost Castle. Backed by the power of the ancient silver dragon Sephitherax, the Alliance can help people overthrow evil despots or theocrats. They are the first to respond to volcanic eruptions or floods to maintain order and defend people from those who might prey upon weakness. An Argentum Agent is a savior and a welcome sight to the impoverished.

Many a fierce dragonborn, inspired by the tales of the bravery of the Alliance, makes his or her way to the summit of the tallest mountain to Hoar Frost Castle, where each expects to be judged by Sephitherax. In the bailey yard of the castle, with thick ice encrusting the flags and silverwork, each dragonborn kneels before the hundred steps before the citadel.

The ancient silver questions each supplicant. When Sephitherax raises his left claw, the candidate is banished from Hoar Frost Castle immediately. When the wise old dragon raises his right claw, the supplicant might one day become an Argentum Agent, but that day is not today. He or she is given a hot meal and sent down the mountain with the expectation that he or she will perform worthy tasks before returning to the Castle one year hence to be judged again. If the candidate is worthy, Sephitherax pronounces him or her an Argentum Agent by raising both claws and embracing the dragonborn. Rarely is a dragonborn raised the first time he or she is presented to Sephitherax; many are judged two or three times before Sephitherax declares the supplicant an Argentum Agent.

Brothers train at Hoar Frost Castle, and they learn to harness the frigid winds from Sephitherax. The color of the scales of an Argentum Agent fade over time and are replaced with a metallic gleam. None are sure if this transformation is due to the icy conditions or the proximity and blessing of the Heart of Sephitherax, an amulet artifact bestowed to the ancient silver by Bahamut.

As a luckbender, your manipulation of chance is a way of life. You're accustomed to turning failure into success and cheating your way through dangerous situations. As your connection to the Elemental Chaos grows stronger, you can influence chaos in the actions of others, as well as place wagers on your own fate by using attacks and abilities that open up the full potential of chance to intervene on your behalf. With this path, you might make deliberate wagers on the whims of chaos, or swagger with the assured confidence of a master gambler. Either way, luck is on your side.

At the birth of every Valenar child, a Keeper of the Past is present to determine the ancestor spirit destined to guide that individual through life. At the end of every Valenar life, a Keeper of the Past judges the deeds of the deceased and ensures that particularly worthy elves are immortalized in history. In this way the Keepers of the Past lead the Valenar from the day of their birth until the day of their death. No matter the power they wield, all Keepers worship and draw upon the power of revered patron ancestors, known collectively as the Spirits of the Past. The key difference between them is not their power source so much as they way in which they draw upon that power. Shamans tend to have a personal connection with a patron ancestor (the shaman is often a direct descendant). Warlords lead by example—putting the advice imparted by ancestor spirits into practice on the battlefield. Bards inspire those around them to emulate the greatest deeds of ancient heroes. Regardless of the exact means by which you do it, as a Keeper of the Past you commune with and channel the advice, guidance, and sometimes direct power of the Spirits of the Past.

You are the master of ways, routes, and paths. You have walked the lightless stone corridors of the Underdark, navigated the winding roads of humans and found your path through the enchanted forests of the Feywild. The labyrinth holds no terror for you. Its endless variations and routes contain your fortress, your philosophy, and your way.

For the minotaur who can discern its patterns, life is a great labyrinth, each new choice a path leading to a different destiny. Few possess the discipline to navigate the vast maze of the mind and soul without losing themselves to temptation and their own savage natures. Guided by the tenets of contemplation, vigilance, and reflection, though your choices have made you master of your own desire.

To the champion of the labyrinth, the battlefield is a maze as familiar as any other, and you move to take advantage of it. You control your own fate, and the direction you choose to travel here. As it is in life, so shall it be in battle.

Serendipity favors you. You have long proved a constant and loyal servant to Avandra by making her interests your own in your ongoing struggle against tyranny and in your willingness to explore the world and sample all it has to offer. Your virtuous soul and good works have won you the goddess's favor, and although you know you were ever in her good graces, you realize you have only touched upon what is possible in her service.

Becoming fortune blessed makes luck your servant, yours to shape and manipulate as you desire. The goddess permits this mastery as long as you advance her aims in the world and remain pure of heart and purpose. You have a knack for husbanding your good fortune and turning setbacks to your advantage. The greater your power becomes, the more the impossible becomes possible until one day you find there is nothing you can't achieve with luck on your side.

Gnomes are known for their prowess with illusions, but many outsiders believe such magic is employed merely for hiding and deception. To the gnomes, though, illusions are much more. They serve as a great equalizer, which they use to attack as well as protect. They can assault the minds of foes directly using well-crafted figments and phantasmal perceptions, which are effective regardless of the physical attributes of those involved.

Your race's natural talent for illusions combines with carefully honed swordmage techniques, creating the path of the phantasm guard. Using your magic, you assail the minds of your foes, and punish those who seek to harm your companions by revealing to them glimpses of their worst nightmares and disguising the true nature of threats.

Phantasm guards are often outwardly charming and compassionate gnomes, expressing a keen understanding of and sympathy for their fellow beings. As one, you act as a trustworthy confidant who is concerned with the plights of others. Frequently interested with exploring the meaning of “truth,” you might engage in philosophical discussions with others to pass the time. However, the purpose of such kindness is just as often more cynical: the goal being to gain and exploit knowledge of potential adversaries so that you can better and more completely defeat your adversaries' minds if and when the time comes.

Blending divine magic with your race's gifts for stealth and cunning, you follow the path of the nightcloak. You bend the shadows that can hide villainy to your own purposes. You seek to protect yourself and your allies from threats, and you seek out evil where it hides under cover of darkness—eliminating it silently, before it can erupt forth to threaten the world of light.

An armored defender of your faith, you nonetheless have learned to become a silent predator, shrouded by protective shadowstuff and able to slip in and strike where foes are least prepared. You can step through the boundary between light and dark to cover distance quickly, or briefly disappear from view to find a new position or to make a surprise attack.

Originally created by adherents of Sehanine for missions requiring some degree of subtlety, the nightcloak tradition has since spread to gnomes of all faiths. Indeed, with the gnome value for secrecy and preservation of outward peace, some would say a group of warriors such as the nightcloaks was inevitability. Many nightcloaks defend hidden gnome communities from danger, venturing out to sabotage or eliminate growing threats without leaving a trace of their presence. Still others travel the world, alone or in like-minded bands of heroes, quietly protecting the interests of gnomes and other goodly races by rooting up the seeds of evil in the darkness that shelters it.

Some might question your covert methods, demanding justice be carried out in full view of all; even considering stealth to be tantamount to cowardice. But you know it's best to fight darkness with darkness so that you can preserve the overall peace of the innocents. And besides—nobody will ever see you.

By day you might cultivate an image of the friendly gnome knight in shining armor, but when darkness falls, you assume a sterner demeanor, silently and ruthlessly hunting down corruption and villainy before sunrise, when you return to your gregarious ways with none the wiser.

You've felt a love for the wilderness for your entire life. Its grand vistas impress you, and even its smallest wonders give you reason for delight. When you learned of Mielikki, it was like reuniting with a longtime friend. You've striven at length in her service, and your efforts have not gone unrewarded.

Mielikki smiles upon those who pursue peace with the natural world and share that view with others. Thus you strive to spread understanding of nature's laws even as you battle to uphold them. It is not enough to protect the world from those who live in it. Instead, those who live in the world must be taught to protect it. Of course, a student does not learn from a teacher with infinite patience; those too stubborn or stupid to learn the error of their ways do not deserve nature's many gifts.

Nobility to the eladrin people is more than status—it is an investiture of power granted by the archfey in exchange for binding oaths and devotion. The eladrin refer to their nobles by many titles, and one traveling in their circles is bound to encounter coure, novier, firre, and others. Each title reflects a particular pact and the magical power gained as a result. The bralani are eladrin nobles who bind themselves to those archfey associated with nature, the seasons, and storms. The power they wield allows them to harness elements and make them their own.

You are a noble eladrin, having earned your greater standing through a pact made with the Winter Court. While the Winter Court expects you to serve it, the archfey rarely call in their debts. Thus you are free to pursue your own agenda as long as it is not at odds with your patron. You can harness winter's power, weaving its wild magical energy into devastating attacks. Your connection to winter triggers other changes. Your skin becomes cold to the touch, your features assume a blue hue, and the air around you holds winter's chill.

You move with liquid grace and in a way that shows that you are unhindered by your environment. The primal spirits with whom you ally yourself guide your steps so that you can move without fear, boldly moving faster than your foes can track. You might use hidden pathways and shortcuts through the world. Or you might have taken your first step into the spirit world and, by doing so, now have the same freedom enjoyed by the land's spirit custodians.

Becoming a swift strider allows you to move with astonishing speed. You can anticipate your enemy's attacks and spring to safety. As you follow this path, your body begins to blur when you move, making it hard for foes to protect themselves from your strikes.

You attack while moving, spin away when your enemies hit you, and, eventually, speed through their ranks, delivering strikes that rob them of their mobility and increase your speed. By moving just outside the reach of your foes, you can deliver punishing attacks with your seeker powers to contain and control them so that your allies can move in for the kill.

Through ancient ceremonies and whispers of vengeance, you bind within your arrows all the rage and indignation you possess. The process transforms each arrow into a macabre length of polished bone capped with a jagged tip and fitted with black fletching. When you fire these wicked barbs from your bow, they bite deep, delivering death's fatal message.

By walking the path of the death arrow, you deliver punishing damage when you attack single targets and can wreak havoc when you spread your attacks among several foes at once. For you, destroying an enemy eclipses any other concern, and thus you commit yourself to annihilating your foes, no matter the cost.

To master the death arrow ceremonies, you must deal with the most unnerving and violent primal spirits. Such contact leaves an indelible mark on you, such that your features grow severe, your eyes wild, and your temper fragile. More than anything, your unwillingness to grant quarter to those who ask it and your single-minded devotion to utterly ruining your foes can prove unnerving to your companions.

You see in the runes a strength greater than that of any mortal power, and you maintain a stern resolution to bring the power of the gods to bear on those who would threaten the world and the astral domains. The first rune of shielding remains carved into the stone at the heart of the world, where members of your order delved into the darkest shadows to defeat primordials of earth and lava. Someday you might make a pilgrimage to that sacred place, but until then you stand at the forefront of any battle. Your runes echo across the battlefield, scattering your foes and fortifying your allies.

As a rune shield, you master a series of secret runes that allow you to cloak your allies in a protective sphere of divine magic. The runes have such power that merely speaking them turns aside arrows, knocks swords and axes away from your friends, and blunts your enemies' most reckless charge.

The forge rune is a rare divine rune that few runepriests learn to master. Only by toiling at a forge for years in training can one hope to learn its secrets. You are one such runepriest. During your apprenticeship, you learned not only the mysteries of divine magic but also the subtle powers of the forge. Guided by the gods and your teachers, you crafted weapons and armor and learned to care for the spiritual and material needs of those who fight for the gods.

A master of the forge draws power from the forge rune, imbuing allies' weapons and armor with divine power. At your behest, blades slice through stone with ease, and armor deflects even a dragon's claws.

Dwarf runepriests are the most common followers of this path. The dwarven heritage of metalwork makes the forge rune a common topic of study among them.

The runes have long been a potent weapon for the gods, and few runes are as mighty as the twelve sigils of the sun. These runes embody concepts of hope, the coming dawn, protection, and endurance. You have studied them in hopes of mastering the divine magic they offer. Few can unlock these runes' power, since they demand a heavy toll from those who study them. You spent hours staring into the sun, almost going blind in the process, to purge your mind of all shadow. Only in such a condition can a runepriest master these runes.

As a light bringer, you carry the sun's radiance to places that have never been blessed with its cleansing light. You harbor a particular hatred of the Shadowfell and the undead creatures that spawn there. There are many creatures that hide from the sun's cleansing light. You have sworn to carry that light to them.

Runepriests study not only the divine runes and the craft needed to shape them, but also the history and story behind each rune. Many runes have been lost over the centuries, usually due to the acts of demons, devils, and primordials. Some runepriests swear to avenge these wrongs, dedicating themselves to crushing those who would stand against the gods. You are one of these runepriests.

Your rune-enhanced prayers harm those who injure your allies. Those fool enough to incite your anger soon learn the error of their ways.

Dragonborn and minotaur runepriests are the most common followers of this path. Both races have developed a keen sense of vengeance for past crimes, and thus this path fits them well.

Psions, especially those who prefer telekinetic powers to telepathic ones, instinctively recognize how the fabric of space is just one side of the swath; the other side is time. Objects, creatures, and worlds travel through both, though time is a direction that has only a single route—forward—while space allows movement any which way.

Or so it seems to most. But for those who are able to literally grasp the fabric of space to stretch, compact, and shape it, time is more malleable, within limits. Understanding this fact opens up new possibilities.

You recognize time's pliability. You already have an arsenal of mental tools capable of gripping the seams in the material of space. You have discovered that you can also use your understanding of the nature of time as a springboard to greater power. As your knowledge of time's intricacies has grown, so has your ability to affect time. You believe you'll soon be wielding time like a sword to cut down your foes before they even understand they're in danger.

Centuries ago, a powerful covenant of warlocks known as the Umbral Cabal summoned a demon lord to do its bidding. The demon, known as Kulnoghrim the Terrible, committed such horrific deeds of carnage and madness that it became too much for the warlocks to bear. The group bound the fiend by using a forbidden ritual, destroying themselves in the process and leaving Kulnoghrim to languish into obscurity.

By studying their methods, you gain the ability to ward yourself from attack and bind your foes as this cabal did the great demon lord. With each secret you uncover, you grow closer to accomplishing what they could not: gaining the ability to bind Kulnoghrim as a vestige and unleashing his demonic fury to burn your enemies and drive them mad.

A tiefling with enough motivation and skill can purge the hereditary infernal magic of their bloodline and replace it with another. The prize demands a price, but a small one, because shifting the watered-down gifts of devils around the world is less arduous than it seems. Not all tieflings are satisfied to give up something at the core of their beings—even to replace it with something else. Those who are brave enough can take more without giving anything up. By taking more of this power, they can gather the might they need to found New Turath, or they can keep the power out of the hands of those who would dare such a dangerous blasphemy.

You have claimed the power of the broken mirrors, whether it is more of the power you already have or an ability that is new to you. Perhaps you stole the power from the devil that originally granted it to your forebears, or you convinced another tiefling to give to you his or her birthright. An infernal power might have granted it to you at a price, or to spite another such power—which might have made you an enemy. Now that you have it, you wield it to your advantage with the same skill and panache that let you acquire it in the first place.

You spent years studying at a remote mountain monastery where your masters taught you to reflect on the mountain's strength and majesty. Through your meditations you learned to become as the mountain, to stand fast against your enemies and repulse their attacks with your unflinching resolve. When not contemplating the mountain's great power, you put your efforts into mastering the fighting techniques your masters taught, and in time, you became like the object of your veneration.

Your fighting style captures the mountain's strength and makes it your own. By focusing your psionic power into your body, you harden your fists, so that you can punch through stone or flesh with equal ease. You also learned to ground yourself, to bind your feet to the ground so that not even the most vicious storm can dislodge you. While so grounded, you can catch your enemies and hurl them away.

The monastery you trained at followed a rare discipline, the school of the dragon's wisdom. Your masters explained that in the ancient days, the dragons taught the mightiest of mortals how to transcend their physical forms and become as mighty as a dragon. Your monastery teaches that with the right focus and discipline, you too can master the secrets of the dragon.

You learn to focus your psionic power outward, unleashing the dragon's fiery breath and turning your skin into an armored hide of dragon scales. You move with the dragon's speed, dancing on the wind with wings of psionic power. Once you master this discipline, you learn how to transform into a dragon for a brief moment.

Half-orc monks are frequently drawn to this paragon path, since their agility and strength serve them well on this path. By the same token, their fiery rage matches the dragon's anger when it is called to battle.

The mind is more powerful than the body, and none demonstrate this principle better than you. As an iron guardian, you have learned to channel psionic energy into your flesh and bones. With a thought, your skin becomes as hard as iron and your bones become as unbreakable as stone. In battle you're a juggernaut, capable of withstanding the fiercest attacks and replying with shattering strikes of your own.

Your unmatched endurance allows you to stand at the forefront of any battle. You exult in the look of despair that crosses your enemy's face as blade, arrow, and claw rebound harmlessly off you. With this confidence, you move to the center of any fight, daring your foes to match themselves against you.

The Order of the Eternal Blade is a secretive group, but you sought out its masters and gained entry. Whatever drove you to the order, you knew you made the right choice when the masters first instructed you. On that day, you first learned to communicate with your blade guide, the psychic resonance of generations of eternal blades that came before you.

The order's first members foresaw the emergence of psionic magic. When those members died, they cast their minds forward in time in search of worthy heirs to their cause. You are one such heir. Your blade guide lingers near you, teaching you the fighting arts of the eternal blades. Even if you fall in battle, your experience shall not be lost, for you too shall cast your mind forward in search of a new champion to guide.

There are shadows in the mind. Unnerving memories, old fears, and crushing disappointments all lie ready to be exploited and manipulated. Those who know these fears can turn them into weapons, amplified until they unravel the consciousness. You are familiar with these fears, and you wield them like razors.

As a stygian adept, you sense the fear and terror in your enemies, harnessing these emotions and using them to attack your foes' minds. With your powers you can create phantom terrors that only your opponent can perceive, distracting the enemy from your allies as they move into position. A foe firmly in your grasp finds itself lost in a maze of half-realized imaginings, each more terrible than the last.

You are a brilliant vessel; you embody hope, joy, and endless confidence, and your presence lifts your allies' spirits. On the battlefield, you wash away despair, dispel doubt, and fuel your allies' passions. As an argent soul, you have an uncommonly pure spirit. You see the best in every situation, finding solutions where others find only defeat. Melancholy has no hold on you, for optimism's light burns away grief. Others find your good nature infectious and strive to rise to your example.

The road to becoming an argent soul is varied. You can simply be a good and wholesome person, untouched by the horrors you have witnessed, or you might have been touched by a god, your soul purified and claimed for a higher purpose. Regardless of the cause of your transformation, it is profound.

Whenever you attack with your ardent powers, a silver corona glimmers around you. Those it touches feel their confidence building, the pain from their injuries falling away so that they can keep fighting no matter the odds.

A shardmind's physical form is an amalgamation of crystalline shards that shardminds believe are fragments of the Living Gate, bound together by force of will into a humanoid form. Every shardmind has a limited ability to alter that form.

You, however, are a shard disciple; you have learned how to relax the bonds of your form to the point where your body becomes a swirling storm of crystalline fragments. You can disperse your body to protect yourself from attacks, and your shard swarm racial power lets you form yourself into a lethal cloud of crystals. As you advance in level, you learn to disperse your consciousness into your component fragments, allowing you to quickly recover from mortal injury or even maintain your consciousness in the form of a swirling storm of shards and psionic energy.

For you, these aspects are not just transient states. They are reflections of nature's versatility and power. As you fight for the preservation of the world, you draw deeply from each aspect. You gain an additional benefit from each aspect while you are bloodied. You have learned ways to funnel the power of nature's aspects into your attacks.

You have mastered the art of war as practiced by the desert nomads. You are an expert at using speed and hit-and-run tactics for skirmishes and raids. Perhaps you are displaced from your original band, a grizzled veteran who now fights in foreign lands. You might be searching for a new band to lead or seeking to whip an existing group into shape. You could have been exiled from your tribe and now live as a rootless wanderer. Regardless of your past, your life brought you into contact with the ways of war, and from that experience, you became an aggressive and resourceful leader.

You learned your style of command in a harsh environment where fear and hesitation aren't options. The unforgiving desert sands shaped you into a keen weapon that has no patience for the luxuries of civilized folk. However, you aren't without honor. Hospitality, kindness to prisoners, and the rules of war must be observed. You seek to destroy your enemies and pillage their camps, but that doesn't mean you're an animal. It's important that tradition is followed. You demand this adherence of anyone who serves with you and under you.

Your allies know you as a hard and fair leader. Everyone receives their due, but dues must be earned. The desert doesn't give easily of her bounty, and neither do your enemies.

You are a renowned captain and a famous leader who is known for generosity toward your troops and ferocity in the face of enemies. You're at your best with allies nearby, fighting back to back against a throng of worthy foes. You grew up in a culture that values camaraderie, honor, cooperation, and nobility. Dirty fighting, deceit, and trickery are anathema to you. You eschew these strategies in favor of sound tactics, strong morale, well-trained warriors, solid armor and weapons, and proper planning. You're not afraid to get your hands dirty, though you believe that respect should be shown to friend and foe alike.

Not everyone has what it takes to be a white raven. You must be mindful of the needs of your allies, the honor of your foes, and your legacy in years to come. You hope to earn your place in the courts of the gods, and you know that such a place is not reached without effort. You plan to do whatever it takes to be worthy of such an honor.

White raven is often a hereditary title akin to nobility in military societies. Despite this tradition, you didn't achieve this rank without proving your skill, valor, and generosity to those older and more experienced in battle and in the ways of the world. You have been given a great honor by having this title bestowed upon you. If you were to die tomorrow, you would be content knowing that you have lived your life to the best of your ability.

Those who live outside the law are fiercely independent. Some are outcasts by nature, but most are driven to the fringes of society because a rigid authority denied them any other place. It's not easy for free spirits to acknowledge their need for leadership. You understand that those who act alone are easier to hunt down. Outlaws must be inspired to band together for their common good. That's where you come in.

Because of your charm and your bravado, and because you never give up, you're the one they rely on for this inspiration. When times are good, you're the one they trust to divvy up the loot. On the days when the law wins, it's you who holds despair at bay and encourages your band to press on. You are a prince of knaves, and no matter what company you keep or how base you might be, none can deny that you have the dignity and magnetism of a born ruler.

A few heroes who follow this path truly are of noble birth. Legends abound with tales of deposed aristocrats toppled from the ruling class and forced to lead a ragtag band of rebels to recapture their rightful heritage. Others hope to use their blades and their wits to carve out a new throne for themselves. Whatever the past and the future hold for you, you know that you will triumph as long as you have your friends close—and a concealed knife even closer.

You are a master of a hard and pitiless combat style. Speeches about hope and ideals aren't for you; you inspire your comrades by showing them how you can rip your enemies to shreds. You're skilled at fighting with weapons that let you hold your foes so your friends can work them over. The spiked chain is your weapon of choice, since it lets you strike from the second rank.

You might have learned your techniques in the fighting pits of a goblin fortress, in the arenas of a decadent city-state, or alongside brigands in lawless lands. You emerged from this crucible as a gang leader, a hard-hearted mercenary, or a skilled gladiator.

You believe that a great destiny awaits anyone who has the audacity to take fate into his or her own hands. Self-awareness, confidence, and a sharp eye for opportunity allow a hero to reach a destiny, yet sometimes destiny needs a little bit of help. And that's where you come in.

You teach your comrades and followers the principles of self-empowerment to help them reach for greater heights. You believe that someone who is alert and grabs opportunities as they come can triumph against any adversary. A force of balance is at work within the world, and fortune, fate, luck, or chance—whatever you care to call it—gathers around the bold like an invisible mantle. Fortune rarely smiles for long on those who prey on others or who stand on the side of iniquity; their day of ill fortune comes eventually. You intend to be there when it does.

Those you lead see you as a good luck charm. They feel empowered in your presence, believing that you have a supernatural gift that improves their chances. You, on the other hand, understand that luck is made, not found. You know that if luck and fate do guide the destinies of you and your friends, without the proper effort and outlook, those destinies will never be fulfilled.

In combat after combat, you have proved that the arrow is among the deadliest of weapons. As you have grown as an archer, you have learned that a band of heroes is like an arrow. To be effective, it needs both a sharp head to guide it and a strong arm to set it in motion, both of which you provide.

Although you value mobility over heavy armor, your physical prowess means that you excel in melee. You try not to get lost in the thick of battle, because you might miss opportunities to bring your keen mind into play. You prefer to survey the battlefield with a glance and direct your allies to strike where an enemy force is weakest. If no such gap in your enemies' defenses exists, you unleash an arrow to create one.

The last blademaster of Arkhosia perished centuries ago, yet you have kept alive the memory of this noble tradition with your study of swordplay and your dedication to the ideals of courage and honor. Part knight, part pilgrim, and part kensei, you are a wandering swordmaster and battle captain in search of causes worthy of your skills. Your tradition isn't merely to face the darkness with sword in hand. You lift spirits and rally resistance, bolstering the courage of allies around you.

Many of the old blademasters were dragonborn, but the elite defenders of Arkhosia accepted skillful and honorable heroes of other races into their ranks. Students of the ancient art of Arkhosian high combat can now be found among races other than dragonborn. Although a few blademasters lose their way and become mercenaries or assassins, most descend into anonymity and continue their noble battle in the shadows. As a blademaster, whether you wear the gilded plate armor of a titled lord, the battered armor of a tireless knight-errant, or the weathered cloak of a poor wanderer, you persevere against oppression, battling it wherever you find it.

Since you first took up arms, you have felt a kinship with wizards, because, like them, you're at your best when your natural talents are honed by careful study. While young wizards were studying the elements and energy of the multiverse, you were studying tactics, especially the strategies that employ magic as a weapon of war. The presence of a powerful mage changes the entire dynamic of a typical battle, and you have worked long and hard to familiarize yourself with exactly how such a weapon can be employed or defended against.

As part of your study of war magic, you have mastered a small amount of magic yourself. However, you realize your full potential when you're leading dedicated spellcasters and putting their powers to good use.

The ancient curse forgeborn dwarves carry manifests itself in different ways. Although united in their uncommon appearance and the single-minded zeal with which they attack their enemies, a few dwarves, often the greatest heroes in their clans, manifest incredible power on the battlefield. When the fury is upon them, their bodies erupt in brilliant flames, obscuring their forms and scorching their enemies. Few forgeborn dwarves endure these transformations. Even the healthiest dwarves cannot withstand the fires burning within them for long, but a rare few learn to control the flames and to use them when most needed so they can destroy the foes they despise.

The mind's eye can travel leagues and leap planes without the body moving a muscle. Imagination and memory move more freely than a ghost. Yet for those with psionic talents, such flights of fancy can be dangerous.

As a tiefling, you couldn't help but cast your thoughts toward the Nine Hells. Visions of the horrors of Baator haunted you, waking or sleeping. When you put your mind to it, you could even feel heat upon your face. You had no idea if these sights were delusions, but you were determined to see more.

Then something looked back.

During an intensely realistic tour of a hellish fortress, your gaze met that of some red-eyed figure. You caught only the glance of an evil eye before blinding pain struck you. Your own eye had caught fire in its socket, and the agony caused you to lose consciousness. When you awoke, your eye and your hellish visions were gone, replaced by a tiny, flickering flame that burned in your empty eye socket. The flame grants you normal vision, but to this day you wonder if you see the world as others do, or if your new infernal eye twists your perception to suit its own purposes.

You channel the the damned spirits of your tiefling ancestors to battle evil.

Those most responsible for the evils of Bael Turath paid with their souls, and yet others who did not shoulder the same responsibility were swept down to the Nine Hells in the bargain. Though far from innocent, these tiefling spirits seek redemption for the evils done to the world in the name of their empire. Their crimes are not your own, but they are your legacy, and you are determined to help your ancestors repay their debt.

The worlds of the living and of the spirits each bear wounds left by Bael Turath. With the help of tiefling souls seeking salvation, perhaps you can heal these wounds. And if you can turn a few mortals away from the path of evil in time to save their souls, so much the better. After all, the burning grip of the devils is not so strong that it can claim souls the world wants saved.

Bael Turath left more than ruins in its wake. Knowledge was also its legacy. No society reaches such great heights without creating great works of architecture, art, magic, and—most importantly—war. Adventurers, scholars, and enthusiasts have long sought the martial secrets taken for granted by the nobles of that infernal empire.

You know one of those secrets: a long-forgotten style of martial combat devised specifically for tieflings, drawing upon their mental faculties and unique physicality to perform amazing stunts. Your study of the Way of the Hell-Kite has granted you a deeper understanding of your body's capabilities and the ability to surpass its limitations.

In a bleak period of the Dawn War, Asmodeus, then merely an exarch, rose up and slew his god. As punishment, the gods imprisoned Asmodeus and his followers in the Nine Hells, and thus the devils were born. Whether in error or wisdom, the gods released Asmodeus when they deemed that one evil was necessary to fight another: the primodials. Who can say now which was the lesser evil, especially since Asmodeus did help to defeat the primordials and imprison them?

You know one thing for certain. The Nine Hells should be a prison. Asmodeus and his devils ought to be locked away to inflict their horrors upon each other. Perhaps they ought never have been released.

You want the devils returned to their hells, and your god blesses your desire. It is your quest that Baator again become the bane of infernal creatures rather than their refuge, and the deity you honor has given you the tools to make that happen. You will not rest until every devil bears the burning chains of its own sins. And when the last divine gate slams shut and the last enchanted lock clicks home, you still will not rest. Hell will need its keepers.

You have been called different names—killer, murderer, assassin—but none fit as nicely as whisperknife does. You kill, but not for wealth and rarely for sport; you kill for vengeance. In a perfect world, everyone would die from old age, but this isn't a perfect world. Accidents happen, and wars claim soldiers and innocents alike. Murderers snuff out lives on a whim or with cold calculation, and the world keeps on turning. Souls wriggle free from their meat to find whatever awaits them in the Raven Queen's frigid embrace. And who stands for these victims? Who protects the people whom justice ignores? You.

You're a vigilante, taking up the cause of those who can't find justice. You use your talents to hunt down anyone who perpetrates crimes. You offer no mercy or quarter, only the whispered name of the wronged party and the silent slash of your blade.

Your preferred weapons are daggers, whether thrown or held. You can hide them on your person and retrieve them with ease. A dagger's short blade allows you to be close enough to your prey to explain why it has to die. And when you've said what you need to say, you can watch as the life goes out of your victim's eyes.

You're a red cloak, a roof-running scoundrel who tests your wits against other denizens of the night. Your colors reflect your passion and signal danger to anyone who isn't prepared to fight you.

You might or might not be versed in the history of your art. In the past, the Red Cloaks were a guild of assassins known for their flamboyance. The true secrets of their activities remain a mystery, but their style—both in fighting and in dress—spread to dandy and street fighter alike.

You might have grown up in the streets, idolizing the swaggering red cloak warriors who ran the rooftops at night. You could be the youngest child of a noble seeking excitement by trying your hand in seedy environs. Instead, you might be a remnant of the original Red Cloaks. Regardless of your motivation, you scoff at those who don the cloak without the attitude or the skill. Any who fight you know that you are no common thug or flouncing dandy.

In your adventures, you seek to test your street-honed mettle against the warriors of other domains. You don't necessarily seek to emulate their style, but you respect it and wish to learn from it. You take every opportunity to challenge the street-runners of other cities, and you will gladly face any enemy that thinks to challenge you.

Few people respect the business of poisons. Among the mighty, poison is considered a weapon of the weak and a dishonorable tool at best. Yet to whom do the mighty and the wealthy turn when they are in need of discreet murder? You, of course, and you're happy to oblige. You never advertise your talents; it wouldn't do for word to spread about your skills. Through prudent inquiries, people in need have a way of finding you. No problem is too big or well protected for your techniques to work, assuming you have enough time and your client has enough gold.

Along with your success comes a raft of enemies. Your victims leave behind friends and relatives seeking revenge. Do they chase after the one who paid you? It would be simpler if they did. Instead, these pursuers come to the one who caused their comrade's end, and that person is you.

Poisoning is a subtle and dangerous art, and a few narrow escapes from angry vengeance-seekers have taught you that discretion is key. Even among your companions, you keep a low profile. It's best to keep your methods of dealing with enemies hidden. However, when you slip a little venom on a blade and the foe falls to the ground, tongue black and neck swollen, your comrades won't look too closely when that act saves them from harm.

The nobility of ancient Bael Turath made certain promises in exchange for power, but your compact with hell is something new. To put it bluntly, you've sold your soul for power. Deep in the Nine Hells, an archdevil holds a contract willingly signed in your hand with your blood.

At the time, the bargain seemed like a good idea: trade away something with no material worth for secrets of arcane power. But the more you learn, the more you worry that you've underestimated the value of what you gave up.

Many have forsaken you, perhaps even some of your own friends. But you hold out hope that you can change the destined tragic ending of your story. After all, you helped write it, so why can't you alter the tale? If nothing else, you'll use the power you've been given to make the collection of your soul more costly than the holder of the contract expects it to be.

You are a creature of stealth—a warrior who treads so lightly that even the autumn leaves remain silent beneath your step. For you, silence is a way of life and an art.

You're comfortable in the forest, where your abilities to move quietly and to camouflage your movements are at their best. You prefer to wear out your foe, dancing from shadow to shadow and from tree to tree, peppering your enemy with ranged attacks. No enemy has yet caught you standing still.

You might have grown up among forest-dwelling elves or fey. It's also possible that you were once a city dweller who has since become one with nature. You still know of and sometimes visit urban areas, but they have become foreign to you. The forest is your home now, and you're as comfortable in it as a street urchin is in the dock ward of a city. When outsiders invade your territory, you strike back with a furious vengeance, assaulting them with rapid volleys of missiles that kill the intruders or drive them away.

Elves and halflings are most likely to follow this path, but any character who favors stealth and silence, uses ranged attacks with great skill, and is an expert forester can succeed as a verdant stalker.

You are a jack-of-all-trades; learning new skills comes naturally to you, and you enjoy pitting your abilities against any challenge. Your thirst for knowledge will drive you to learn new skills until the day you die.

Since your youth, you have had an intense yearning to learn more than what books and teachers could provide. You understood from a young age that knowledge and skill can take you places that money and influence can't. You hoard knowledge the way a dragon covets its treasure, though you are happy to share it with anyone you consider worthy, or when doing so suits your fancy.

Folks might consider you a pack rat or a dabbler, but you know that the items you collect and the skills you acquire will help you in the future. And when you're there to save the day, anyone who derided your habits will realize the mistake and thank you.

Eladrin are a natural choice for this path because of their high Dexterity and Intelligence, as well as the fact that they gain an additional skill of their choice. Humans also excel as jacks-of-all-trades because of their vast variety of experiences and versatility of skill and knowledge.

The sling is a humble weapon, favored by commoners such as shepherds and farmers. It is useful for chasing off predators and bandits, but it lacks the prestige enjoyed by crossbows and light blades. Despite its lowly stature, the sling has its adherents. Among these enthusiasts, the daring slinger is the most dangerous, for these rogues elevate the simple weapon, making it the equal of any other ranged weapon.

As a daring slinger, you appreciate the weapon's subtle assets. A sling is small. It can be compressed and hidden. Slings are also resistant to the elements. You can dunk one in water, stretch it, or abuse it, and the weapon continues to work—something that can't be said of bows and crossbows. Best of all, ammunition is never a problem; any small stone will do.

Through extensive training, you've improved your accuracy, exceeding what archers can do with a longbow. Your range is equal to that of a crossbow, and your bullets pack an equal punch.

Most knaves are little more than ruffians who have a talent for swordplay. These individuals prowl city streets and pit their skills against each other, trying to prove themselves. Most of these so-called bravos have more courage than common sense. They have short life spans and usually wind up in shallow graves. You, however, have proved you're different from them.

You never had formal training or studied under a master. Instead, you developed a haphazard style born of necessity and emboldened by your grit. You quickly learned that survival demands toughness, so you cultivated the ability to keep scrapping even with your back pressed to the wall.

In battle, your attacks lack the finesse and artfulness exhibited by other rogues, yet they are equally effective. Just because you don't have a fancy flourish doesn't make you any less dangerous.

You've never been content to stick to one path. Magic and larceny, spell and trap, dweomer and shadow—for you, all came easy. You learned to fuse your knowledge into one style, both in and out of battle.

When you were a child, you dreamed of grand achievements. You enjoyed the shows of illusionists and magicians, and you reveled in the skill of pickpockets and burglars. You followed two divergent paths that eventually came together in your mind as a way of life and a cohesive style of attack. You don't separate the martial from the magical, and you are mildly scornful of anyone who is so shortsighted as to make this division.

You never sought a position in an arcane order or a thieves' guild; you didn't want to limit yourself. Instead, you learned to recognize that each adventure is an opportunity to test your mettle, sharpen your skills, enhance your magic, and discover treasures.

Eladrin are naturals for this path because of their agility and keen intellect. Arcane tricksters are found among gnomes, changelings, and drow as well. Some use their knowledge and power for adventure, and others use it for theft, torture, and deception.

You have studied the ways of the Snow Tiger barbarians of the cold forests. You might count Snow Tigers among your relatives, having won their respect during your travels in their lands or as a youth fostered by the tribe. Or perhaps you befriended a Snow Tiger wanderer who taught you the woodcraft skills and fighting style of these fierce folk. You might be an enemy of the barbarians who has learned to mimic the wild fighting style of the Snow Tigers. Regardless of how you came to learn the way of the Snow Tigers, your knowledge makes you a warrior of unusual ferocity.

Like your barbarian fellows, you see little reason to use any weapon larger than a dagger. In your view, heavy armor and weapons are crutches; the true test of a warrior lies in strength and savagery. If you can't best your foe with a dagger, why should you fare any better with a bigger piece of steel? The predators of the northern lands—bear, tiger, wolf, and griffon—have nothing more than their own fangs and claws, and few humans can match those creatures' power and lethality.

Master of tundra and taiga, glacier and permafrost, you might be a bloody-handed reaver or a noble monster-slayer. Whichever path you choose to walk, you do so fearlessly, for you have the hard-won respect of the Snow Tiger warriors.

In the depths of the Howling Forest lies a realm of wonder and magic—the eladrin city of Shinaelestra, the legendary City of Rangers. Each night Shinaelestra shifts silently across the veil separating the Feywild from the mortal world. It appears in the forest depths for a few hours before fading back to the Feywild at sunrise. The feral monsters and savage humanoids haunting the Howling Forest have learned to give the eladrin city a wide berth, for each night the guardians of Shinaelestra range far over the twisted paths and shadowed dells in search of evil's servants.

You have dwelt among Shinaelestra's vine-covered ruins and tree-shaded manses, learning from the great ranger lords who govern the city. You might have visited the city between adventures, or perhaps you lived and studied there long ago and have now reached a sufficient level of achievement to call yourself a Shinaelestran guardian. You are welcome to return to Shinaelestra any time you wish to take up service with Lord Calenon, the ruler of the city. However, the skills you learned in the City of Rangers are in great demand throughout the world, and you can honor your old mentors by battling monsters and savagery wherever they threaten people of good heart.

You have grown up on the edge of society, living a life that forced you to perform deeds you want to forget. Combat was not a choice but a means of survival. You might have once been a pirate or a highway brigand. Now, you turn your talents against any that remind you of the monster you used to be. You bring the fight to your foe and don't discriminate against opponents. An enemy is an enemy, from a simple cutthroat to the vilest warlord.

You don't consider it your job to protect the weak and innocent; plenty of others accept that role. Your expertise is in understanding the ways of scoundrels and raiders, for their methods were once your own. You don't follow a lofty code or care how others see you—you fight dirty, and it suits you.

Your fight is with pirates that raid fishing villages, criminal organizations that collect protection money, or invading bands of drow that seek slaves for their Underdark homes. You need no rank and have no desire to be limited by any hierarchy. Interference from government slows down what you need to do. You might not be a traditional hero, but you fight traditional villains.

Through subtle manipulation and quick feints, you excel at isolating an opponent from a group. You use tactics like those of a wolf, focusing on your foe and drawing it away from any assistance. For you, combat is an art form. You choose your target with the same care that a sculptor chooses a block of marble.

You relish the point in battle when the plans of your enemies fall apart. In one-on-one combat, you fight on your terms. You are the razor that cuts out the heart of a group, leaving the rest of your foes in disrepair. You're a master at choosing the terrain you fight in and the opponent you fight against.

Even though you prefer to act on your own, you rely on your friends to confound enemies and split their focus. This strategy gives you the opportunity to move in and employ your skills. While the others in your group are busy engaging foes and helping each other out of danger, you're busy taking down the choicest foe.

You are a renowned beast-slayer, honored for your skill at tracking down and killing ferocious monsters. No one is a better tracker than you are, and your finely honed senses make it difficult for your enemies to surprise you.

The spear is your weapon of choice, because it's suited to the hunter's work. Archery has its place, but too often you face your foe in dense thickets or cramped lairs, where the bow is a poor choice. If you find a few yards of clear terrain for a clean toss, you can throw the spear with deadly effect. If not, it's a simple, quick, and handy weapon that can deal lethal blows from just outside the range of claw or fang.

Although you're good at killing, you have no taste for wanton slaughter—for you, the greatest challenge lies in pitting your skill and strength against wicked or bloodthirsty beasts, creatures that lesser hunters fear to seek out. Dire boars and cave bears are more to your taste than common woodland creatures, and fantastic beasts such as griffons and wyverns offer an even more stirring challenge.

Inspired by the way a wasp swarm engulfs an enemy, you overwhelm opponents with a mass of arrows or bolts. You are a master of the Harrowing Swarm style. You make relentless attacks that panic your foes and deliver seemingly endless waves of pain.

By perfecting the style, you can disrupt your opponents and cause lingering wounds. You have studied the wasp's streamlined grace and learned how to stay on the move and reduce the damage inflicted by your foes' attacks. A harrowing swarm archer does not balk at melee. You might pick ranger powers that are reactive or powers that allow you to shift quickly through battle. That way, you can quickly escape any dangerous situations and then strike back against foes that confronted you.

Harrowing swarm archers often train as town or militia archers before taking up the discipline. You might pursue adventure for a variety of reasons. Perhaps you seek treasure or fame, or maybe you want to hunt the most dangerous and feared beasts so that you can test your skill against them. As a harrowing swarm archer, you have made a study of nature, observing the physical defenses of natural creatures. You have applied those lessons to your own technique, so now, wherever you go, you feel confident that your foes will respect your sting.

Beneath the world of daylight lies a vast realm of eternal night—the caverns, tunnels, and vaults of the Underdark. This wilderness of stone is home to dangerous monsters and rapacious civilizations that plague the world, and it's here you're at home. You have explored the lightless passages and wandered the uncounted miles of labyrinthine caves. The bizarre ecology of this subterranean world is as familiar to you as the flora and fauna of a surface forest; you know how to survive where other heroes would find a cruel, swift death.

As a darkstrider, you are part explorer, part guide, and part hunter. You have made it your task to discover the secret paths and hidden strongholds of the Underdark, mastering the unique dangers of this horrible realm and learning the ways of the creatures and peoples who call it home. You could serve as a spy, keeping watch on the plots of the drow or the mind flayers. You might be an exterminator, fighting a shadowy war against teeming hordes of troglodytes and grimlocks in foul caverns beneath the mountains. Or you might be a subterranean trailblazer, skilled at finding treasures long hidden from the light. In any case, survival in the Underdark is a game of stealth, sharply honed senses, ambush, and savagery—and you understand its rules perfectly.

Every ranger needs to tap into the beast inside; this task is especially simple for a shifter like you. You have honed your senses. You can smell blood in the air and hear the sound of your foe's racing heartbeat; at times, you can even taste the fear you inspire. By embracing the animal inside you, you become a true hunter.

Some shifters suppress their animal instincts, but you crave the adrenaline rush that comes over you when you unleash your inner beast. Your muscles are charged and your senses are enhanced. It's at these times that you feel alive and you are most dangerous to your enemies.

You gain resilience through unleashing the beast inside you. You have spent extensive time alone in the wild, where beasts were your only companions. You have studied them, watched the way they move and fight. Like them, when you become injured, you're even deadlier. You gain speed, strength, and ferocity. Your opponents would do well to eliminate you quickly; otherwise, they'll find that you're at your best when you're in the last throes of life.

The realm of mortals is the battlefield of the gods. Forbidden to manifest their power directly, the gods rely on intermediaries to fight their battles. Some heroes volunteer their strength to this divine cause, but not you. Your training taught you how to wield a weapon, not a holy symbol, and to place your faith in your armor and your own courage. As a warrior of outstanding courage and skill, you have caught the attention of Bane, the god of war, and his heavy gaze lies upon your battles and quests.

Some who fall under Bane's gaze embrace their role as paragons of war, serving the Black Hand willingly. You are not bound to this fate. Bane is a terrible tyrant, yet he has great admiration for mortals who excel in martial virtues such as discipline, courage, and skill at arms. Above all, Bane is delighted by victory. A hero who battles for good and eschews tyranny might oppose what Bane stands for, but if he or she is brave, skillful, and triumphant, the master of war is darkly pleased even in defeat.

You are a swordmaster of renown and an expert in the famous Steel Vanguard style. This style is based on the use of large, heavy swords such as the greatsword and the falchion. Few can match your skill and lethality with a two-handed sword.

Some combat styles are associated with specific schools, academies, or regions; the Steel Vanguard technique is not one of these styles. It was developed centuries ago in the mercenary companies that served the empires of old. Countless variations and embellishments have been added to the style over time. Currently, the mercenaries known as the Steel Vanguard practice the style, and dozens of distinct regional styles have their roots in the base style.

As a famed swordmaster, you might be sought out by students who want to learn your techniques or by challengers eager to earn a name by besting a warrior of your skill. How you deal with such challenges is up to you. Between adventures, you might run a training school, teach at a famous academy as a visiting instructor, tutor young nobles, or take on an apprentice for a time. When adventure calls again, you set aside your lessons and once again use the martial skills you have honed over years of fighting.

Your arrival is heralded by the crash of splintering wood and the roar of a battle cry. When you smash through a door with a single swing of your massive weapon and barrel into the midst of your enemies, they dodge out of the way—if they're wise. If battle has taught you anything, it's that weight plus momentum equals deadly force. When you set your bulk in motion, anyone smart knows to stay out of your way.

Goliaths are famous for defending mountain passes with a squad of slingers, a pile of boulders, and a rampaging brute who rushes downhill and slams into the leader of the opposing force as a killing rain of rock and stone smashes that foe's allies. Goliath legends tell of the first rampaging brute, Roglarok, who charged into the midst of a company of hobgoblins beneath Tizun's Halls. No one in his tribe could have defeated them single-handedly, but by drawing the defenders off, Roglarok allowed his allies to achieve a victory by sneaking in behind the distracted hobgoblins.

Your tactics as a rampaging brute focus on charging in and tying up foes, keeping them away from the more frail members of your party. Your preferred weapon is a heavy weight at the end of a sturdy haft. You favor light armor or chainmail so that your charges can carry you farther into the heart of the battle. You'll be hit frequently, but your fury will keep you fighting no matter how grievous your wounds become.

You are a rakehell duelist because you're the best at what you do. With a weapon in each hand, you rely on fast footwork and skillful parries. You scorn combatants who need half an hour to strap on heavy armor before they can do battle. By the time other warriors are ready, you can dispatch three sets of opponents and two flagons of ale. Knowing that a fight is around the corner, you make sure you're prepared and that you enjoy life while you can.

You have won riches and fame by going up against deadly opponents. Although your talents have earned you the means to retire to a life of luxury, you find that your pursuit of the good life seems to end up causing fights. For a rakehell duelist, that's the point. Boasting, gambling, and courting the attractive and the wealthy is fun because it can result in being challenged to a duel.

Your reputation attracts a constant stream of aspiring duelists seeking to test themselves against a master. A rakehell duelist usually relishes each opportunity to confirm that he or she is still on top, mercilessly dispatching any ambitious upstarts.

You are a well-traveled veteran, a pragmatic mercenary who has fought in a dozen different lands. Along the way, you've come to appreciate the virtues and drawbacks of various weapons. Sometimes you're a soldier, sometimes a bodyguard, and sometimes a freebooter in search of the next opportunity. Wherever you go and whatever you do, though, you're always a master of arms.

Many who share your combat style are heartless sellswords, fighting only for the next bag of gold. You might be motivated by coin, or you could find yourself drawn to a higher cause. Perhaps you pursue a calling as a wandering trainer, instructing castle guards and village militias in the effective use of their weapons. You might be a footloose traveler, searching for a worthy place or cause to serve with your martial skills. Or you might be a renowned troubleshooter, awaiting the next chance to test your skills against violent brigands or fierce marauders. You're willing to slay monsters and dangerous beasts if that's what needs to be done, but your true calling is to face enemies that have steel in their hands and prove your mastery over them.

You are a battle-tested master of the Ironstar combat style. You wield a mace or a flail as easily as a graceful elf duelist wields a rapier; in your hands, these cruel weapons are as light and quick as willow switches. You have spent countless hours attaining the necessary balance, concentration, and intuition to use these weapons effectively. With uncanny precision, you can crumple a shield, break a weapon-hand, shatter fangs, or crush a skull.

Beyond mastering the style's pure physical technique, you have absorbed the attitude and mindset of the Ironstar masters. Your chosen style is more than pure strength and savagery. You recognize that fearlessness, intimidation, and aggression are weapons every bit as important as the maces or flails you wield.

Warriors of different races and lands have developed techniques similar to yours, but none have studied them more carefully—or practiced them more fiercely—than the dwarf masters who originated the Ironstar technique. You have learned from their teachings and become a fierce and tough-minded warrior. You are the first to charge into the fray and the last to leave it. Enemies do well to fear you.

You are a warrior of tremendous athleticism and skill. For you, battle is the ultimate competition—a contest in which your personal triumphs and deeds of daring will win you lasting glory. You measure your victories by the fame and recognition they bring you. Folks might say that you're proud, vain, or selfish, and that your hubris is an affront to the gods. You see nothing wrong in wanting to glorify the natural gifts the gods granted you or demonstrating to the world the rewards that can be won with courage, dedication, and skill.

You value fame, honor, and the stories of your triumphs over gold and other worldly treasures. You're on the lookout for opportunities to add to your own growing fame, not through bragging about what you've done but by testing yourself against worthy foes and producing evidence of your victories. If you can't fight the dragon on the village green, then at least you can bring back its head tied to your saddle horn to let everyone know that you bested the creature.

You have little interest in dishonorable victories or foes beneath your station. If you must give battle to unworthy enemies to protect innocent people, you might choose to set your own challenge by wielding ineffective weapons, using only simple attacks, or allowing your opponents the first strike. Defeating a band of goblins hardly adds to your renown at this point in your career, but defeating them with your bare hands—now there's a story.

You're both a warrior and a warlock, steeped in the martial lore of the Nine Hells. You might have learned the sinister techniques of this path from another practitioner, from forbidden tomes guarded in brooding monasteries, or from the infernal patrons who answer your call when you dabble in the warlock's craft. Regardless of how you came to follow this path, you wield the power of an infernal pact; what you choose to do with your dark gift is up to you.

As an Avernian knight, you combine the power of a warlock's pact with exceptional skill at arms, weaving sinister spells into your weapon. In battle, you call upon your spells to scour your foes with infernal curses and punish them severely when they ignore your challenge.

Orders of Avernian knights are found in the Nine Hells and in other places where devils hold sway. Most who wield the power of the Nine Hells do so at the cost of their souls and are irrevocably sworn to the service of evil. However, you need not choose evil to follow this path. Sometimes good heroes succeed in turning the power of evil against itself, finding a way to withstand the taint of the dark powers.

Confidence is why you always win. Even when you are faced with a setback, your resolve never wavers, and you're certain you will overcome adversity no matter how severe. Some people mistake your confidence for arrogance or foolishness, but you prove the truth of your words time and again, showing your detractors your might.

You back up your confidence with your psionic mastery, wrapping your soul, body, and mind in a barrier of willpower to deflect any attack you face, whether it strikes your body or mind. With this unwavering resolve, you can dismiss a foe's strikes, standing undaunted before its best efforts to hurt you. And with this security, you project your personality onto those you fight, flooding their minds with the imminence of their defeat.

Without formal training, you learned your techniques in a haphazard fashion, unlocking your potential with each contest, awakening new techniques as you blended psionic power with your weapon strikes. At some point during your battles, you began to hear a faint wailing—subtle, quiet, but definitely present. Now when you fight, the breeze whips up into a storm, lending new strength to your attacks.

What you hear are psionic winds swirling around you. Your crude methods cause psionic power to bleed from you. Instead of dissipating, it swirls, blowing around you, unseen and unnoticed by any but you and the enemies who stand against you. When you reclaim this power, your body undergoes a strange transformation, becoming disjoined from reality for a moment or two before you snap back into place.

The more you work with this loosed psionic power, the more ephemeral you become. You can stir up the power to rip through your enemies' minds, or you can draw it into yourself to vanish and reappear where least expected.

The Traveler is the true lord of Eberron, because his feet have treaded all its paths, and his eyes have seen all its sights. Her smiling face and dark cunning have left all she beheld transformed. It, this god, has guided your straying feet onward with only the revelation of the next day's happenings as your goal. You have wrought change as change will alongside your companions. And such change is always for the better, just as action is better than inaction. You know this well.

An instigator among your allies, you move the tale ever forward. The Traveler's voice always calls you onward, from over the next hill or through the next door. With cunning, you rely on the strengths of you and your allies, and you use them all to manipulate your foes into the weakest position. What you lack, you make up for with resourcefulness, unpredictability, and sheer luck.

When did you first know that your awareness of the world around you is unique? Perhaps you were underground when a gust of wind blew out your torches, leaving your party in utter darkness from which only you could lead the way back. Or maybe you were attacked under cover of a thick fog and shouted out, “Retreat and regroup at our last campsite!” Only after you said this did you realize that you were the only one for whom that was as easy to find as your own foot. Your comrades have long relied on your intuition to determine which tunnel leads to the surface and where you will find higher ground that better allows you to defend yourself against your pursuers.

Some primal mappers are disciples of Lugos's teachings, while others have discovered his principles independently. You took your first steps toward the path of the primal mapper when you became aware that each of the places in the world has its primal spirit of place—a spirit intimately connected to its location. Your devotion to noticing and remembering every detail of the lands you travel makes you akin to these spirits of place. Like them, your abilities go beyond a superior tactical understanding of position and landscape and into a mystical realm where making a representation of a place gives you power over it. You need not even physically create a map to provide a connection by which spirits from that realm can enter the mundane world; simply visualizing one will suffice. Let those who would stand in your way beware!

Some dragons are like forces of nature, the elemental power coursing through their bodies akin to the mightiest forces of storm, earth, or sea. The catastrophic dragons embody the destructive forces of nature, but even the blue dragon is a living incarnation of the storm. Your mastery of primal magic has led you to this path: Like these dragons, the power of the storm flows in your blood and erupts in your breath.

Your allies in the spirit world are draconic spirits of wind, lightning, and thunder, heeding your call to rebuke your enemies, carry your allies on the wind, or transport you through the storm. As you advance on the path of the storm dragon, your appearance changes to reflect the nature spirits you commune with—you might develop the blue scales and prominent horn of a blue dragon, or something of the churning elemental appearance of a typhoon dragon. By the time you reach the end of the path, wings sprout from your back, and you fight with all the savagery of the storm dragon.

A few dragonborn clans are not true clans. Unbound by family ties, these individual warriors join together around a common ideal. These are warrior societies that celebrate the dragonborn ideals of honorable combat and glorious victory, while celebrating what makes them dragonborn—the dragon within that empowers their dragon breath. Each of these warrior clans has a patron dragon type, and the members of those societies typically emulate their patron dragons in a variety of ways, from alignment and behavior to the damage type of their dragon breath.

As an honorable blade, you have reached the pinnacle of such a warrior clan. You have begun to master its most exotic fighting techniques, starting with the ability to sheathe your weapon in the same draconic energy that powers your racial breath power. Your techniques are purely martial, but they embody the physical qualities of dragonkind, just as you strive to embody their behavioral qualities in your own deeds.

Many dragonborn who adopt divine classes follow Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, but few study the esoteric disciplines of the Platinum Temple. This ancient shrine, located on a remote mountain peak that is said to straddle the boundary between the natural world and Bahamut's domain in Celestia, teaches a particular form of mysticism that is unique to dragonborn, for its goal is to be increasingly formed into the likeness of Bahamut himself.

Through prayer and meditation, and more important through the rigorous discipline of walking a just and honest path through the world, you apply the teachings of the Platinum Temple to your life. You strive to think as Bahamut would and face every situation with his sense of righteousness and honor. At the same time, you train your body and channel divine power through it, until your scales begin to gleam with the silvery-white color of platinum. With time and further study, you learn to momentarily sprout great draconic wings, speak Supernal with Bahamut's own authority, and breathe a billowing mist like the Platinum Dragon's potent breath weapon.

Such power is meaningless, however, if you do not use it in service to Bahamut's highest ideals.

Gloaming guardians protect their communities from intruders and occasional trespassers, but even the barrier they create cannot catch all who prowl their lands. Should their communities come under attack, the dusk elves flee, vowing vengeance on those who wrong them. The darkening blades embody the vengeance they swear and to them the dusk elves turn to destroy their enemies.

As a darkening blade, you have mastered a secret fighting style perfected through generations spent in exile. Shadows gather around you so that when you move, you blend into them, making it hard for your enemies to track your movements and attack you. When you strike, you do so with speed and accuracy, darting in, then melding into the gloom.

Long ago, when aberrant monsters first spilled into the mortal world, a warrior society was formed to protect the world from the Far Realm's corrupting influence. The society's members recorded their techniques in a volume known as the Talaric Codex. In it were the forms and disciplines needed to master their psionic fighting art. In the countless years since its formation, the society has decayed and dissolved. Its monasteries have fallen, and the writings of its adepts have been scattered across the world.

You have found fragments of writing from this ancient society and learned to focus your psionic powers to give you a tactical advantage in battle. Because your training was haphazard and pieced together from fragments of lore, you improvise where your training is incomplete, drawing from your ardent powers to fill your gaps in knowledge. Still, the teachings you uncovered proved instructive, and you can take charge of nearly any battlefield.

Central to your learning is the ability to read your enemies' intent and turn it against them. You translate the clarity of your vision and your openness to the thoughts and experiences of those around you into a decided tactical advantage. You can warn allies against impending attacks, move companions to adapt to enemy formations, and help your allies scatter when they are faced with devastating magic.

Though no chains bind them, your enemies become your prisoners. You are a psionic binder, a living prison whose thoughts are as strong as adamantine bonds. When you engage your foes, you redirect their thoughts inward, forming mental walls to constrain their thoughts and root them to the spot. You can keep your enemy imprisoned long enough for your allies to close in and deliver whatever justice the foe deserves.

The aberrant menace is a wily threat, slipping unseen into the mortal world and spreading its corrupting influence to foment unrest and mutation wherever it goes. No matter how many aberrant monsters are destroyed, others spawn to spread wickedness. The only answer is containment. By pinning down the threat, you can destroy it, one monster at a time.

By no means are your efforts exclusive to aberrant enemies. Any who stand against you in your single-minded pursuit deserve your dread attention.

Some invokers have learned to harness Amoth's lingering might by using the powers presented, but a few—a rare but growing few—have gone further. They have devoted themselves in full to Amoth, spreading justice in his memory and drawing at least in part on his own surviving might to do so. 
You are one of these select few. Whether you have dedicated yourself exclusively to Amoth's teachings, or serve other gods of justice in memory of Amoth, you draw upon the lingering energy of the murdered Lord of Kalandurren. As an arbiter of forgotten justice, you know that one must deal with the evils that plague mortals and gods alike. Their crimes must be punished—from simple human greed to the murder of Amoth.

Spell commanders are artificers who transform their allies into walking weapons of arcane destruction. Typically found as a part of more militaristic arcane institutions, spell commanders learn magic that help them increase their allies' spell power. Additionally, most spell commanders work as a part of a small squad, and many of the spells they wield are focused around small squad tactics, including rapidly moving across the battlefield.
Most spell commanders receive standard military training, including the foundation of small arms use (particularly bows and crossbows). Spell commanders combine conventional military education with their arcane knowledge to create a more hybridized approach to warfare.
As a spell commander, you know how to combine traditional combat techniques and weapon use with the power of arcane magic. Your focus is on transforming your allies into more accurate, more powerful, and more mobile forces, effectively taking on the role of a squad leader who uses spells to facilitate this transformation.

Arcane armorers are skilled artificers who have focused their knowledge on enhancing the defensive capabilities of their allies. Many arcane armorers combine their knowledge of armorsmithing with their skill with the arcane arts, augmenting their allies' defenses in a way that others cannot.
Arcane armorers are especially talented at weaving enchantments over their allies' armor that not only enhances the armor but also turns the ally into a walking weapon. Arcane armorers can use the energy they imbue into an ally's armor as a method of delivering powerful spell charges at their enemies. Similarly, arcane armorers use their allies' armor as anchors, connecting enemies to their allies, draining energy from one to boost the other.
As an arcane armorer, you focus your efforts on turning your allies into your magic weapons out on the battlefield. You want your allies to move up close to the enemies you face, protecting them from afar while using them to deliver your own attacks. When your allies are in trouble, you shield them from further danger, or pull them back from the front lines.

In ancient Arkhosia, arcane spellcasters studied the Ninefold Path, a way toward both arcane mastery and spiritual awakening. The steps along the path represent an increasing attunement to the draconic energies in the initiate's being, a practice that unites the study of magic with the innate characteristics of the dragonborn race.
You are a master of the Ninefold Path, on your way toward arcane perfection as the scholars of Arkhosia understood it. Your dragon breath is another spell in your arsenal, and when you use spells that create the same elemental force as your breath, you demonstrate mastery over the magic that powers them.

Rumor and legend speak of horrifying Vistani curses. Few are willing to put these dark parables to the test. Threat of ill fortune or a wasting disease is enough to keep the Vistani safe from numerous threats. 
Folk do well to heed the folktales, because the stories are true. Of this fact you are living proof.
Although many a Vistani knows the magic to place a lasting curse on someone who has offended the clan, you are something more. In an instant, with but a glare and an oath, you can turn fortune against your adversaries. Those who dare raise their hands against you soon see the folly of their actions.
Any who show you the respect and camaraderie you deserve have little to fear. While standing beside you or watching your back, your allies benefit from the bad luck you hurl at your foes. They could even say that you bring  them good fortune instead of afflicting enemies. Despite the reality, with a sly Vistani smile, you might let them believe this is true.

Death is the natural course for all things, from the lowly insect to the mightiest of gods. It is not an end, of course, but a beginning—the first step onto the road into the unknown. For you, death offers little fear or concern because you are confident that the Raven Queen will shepherd you to whatever fate your long service has earned. This comfort and understanding forms the cornerstone of your beliefs, and you carry this message wherever you go, consoling the grieving or speeding those who deserve to meet the Raven Queen on their way.

The soul of erosion combines the two most insinuating elements: water and its destructive cousin acid. Those who pursue this path perfect a devastating fighting style that sweeps foes aside even as it sears them.

Some genasi who follow this path consider the union of water with its Abyssal analogue a measured balance of the natural and the unnatural. Others think of it as diluting their corruption with purity, and cruel minds consider it tainting the purity of the watersoul with the bile of the Abyss. All you know is that, whatever anyone else thinks, your abilities get the job done.

What is, the void consumes. To attack the void is of the utmost futility, because it has no point of weakness, no vulnerability, and nothing to sever or destroy.

The scion of absence studies and learns from the voidsoul association with the inverted fundament: the lack of all things. Most are philosophic warriors or masters of magic, seeking the nonaction that achieves their goals. Others resemble destructive forces of nature that no one can easily stop.

Despite the petty discrimination that Abyssal genasi endure, they make their own way through the world. Some flourish; many falter. A few look beyond the unpleasantness of the world to the true cause of their pain: the Abyss.
You have declared war on the source of your corruption, but you do not deny the power that the Abyss has granted you. Instead, you have decided to seize as much of the Abyss's power as you can grasp, and will turn this power back on its source, wielding it against the forces of the Abyss.

Death frees souls from the concerns of life, but some wrongs the departed remember—even if the mind has long rotted away. You're the ghost of a life you barely recall; yet, you can't forget what they did. And you won't forgive it either. Some power put you back in this world, and whether or not it did so for this reason, you're out for revenge. Of course, those who wronged you in the past aren't the only ones on your hit list. You received a second chance, and this time you're not letting anything slide.
With each enemy you bury, you feel a little hollower. The cold rage gives way to a numbing chill, and life—your previous one and the half-life you now lead—slips quietly away into oblivion. Still, what difference does it make? You're already dead.

While the dragonborn suffered under the reign of the Empress Dragon of Skelkor, many were left adrift in the world, their families and homes taken from them without warning or care. Some of these dragonborn from the tribes at the fringes of civilization learned to awaken their latent magic and fuel their primal fury with arcane power. Becoming the scourge of dragons and their allies, these relentless warriors lived to bring down their prey. In time, they taught their secrets to tribes of other races that also suffered under draconic rule. You are one of their kind, a dragonfoe ragespell, a cauldron of rage and power set upon a mission to rid the world of the creatures that once enslaved your people.

You blend the primal fury of your tribe's roots with your innate manipulation of arcane forces to become the ultimate big game hunter. You prefer to take on your sworn enemy—dragons—but your abilities lend themselves well to bringing down any big threat your group might face. You take many risks getting up close to creatures that tower above you, but you know that without fully giving into the fury that constantly smolders within you, there would be no future for your tribe.

Not all that lived in the western Great Rift perished during the calamity that resulted in the creation of the Underchasm. Some managed to survive in small, isolated groups by keeping themselves one step ahead of the drow and other Underdark horrors that prowl the depths. Vowing to defend their heritage at all costs, many of these deep earth dwellers made pacts of power to keep their kind safe and strike back at the creeping evils on the edges of their enclaves. You have chosen this path, becoming a stalwart protector of your kind, but it was not without sacrifice that you came to your power.
You have emerged from the depths of the Underchasm and have seen and heard terrible things that few others have experienced firsthand. Your dark connection to entities beyond this world has steeled your resolve to fight against the enemies of your people, and your bond with the earth is unbreakable.You serve as a valuable guide when your group heads underground, but you're also a very capable protector when the time comes to fight, steeled by years of a harsh, lightless existence.

In the days of old Shyr, the practices of the swordmage were forbidden to all but the favored of the ruling primordial Karshimis. Many genasi, however, took to the wilds outside of civilization to learn their ancestral craft in secret. Deep in the wilds, some of these students found masters that had become sympathetic with the primal world, carrying on an ancient discipline that blended arcane prowess with primal resonance. You have carried on this tradition, calling your spirit ally to your mystic blade, resulting in a fighting style unknown to almost all others on Toril.
You have an intense bond to both your blade and your spirit friend, such that both have become inseparable from you. You often act as an emissary between the wilds of the frontier and the learned halls of civilization, spending time in both worlds. Your balanced upbringing means others often rely upon you to be the source of stability when things go awry.

You might have trained at a fighting school or served in a military outfit, but you found all that discipline and all that rigorous training unnecessary. You see no finesse in swinging an axe. You hit someone and they fall. If they don't fall, you're doing it wrong—a problem corrected by just hitting them harder next time. Some warriors sneer at you, dismissing your accomplishments as luck, but the veterans know the truth: You are a killing machine. That's why they call you the siegebreaker. Oh, not because you are good at driving enemies off, but because you are damn good at punching holes through your enemies' defenses and bringing stalemates to sudden, bloody ends.

You are the guardian of two worlds. You know the perils of the wild, but you also know the corruption that dwells in the heart of civilization. Many wardens eschew civilization in favor of the purity of nature. Although you see the virtue in their point of view, you have chosen to straddle both realms in the hopes of keeping an eye on each. You know that if either becomes too dominant, neither can flourish. So you live and work, instructing people on how to interact with and be respectful of the forest, but also protecting them from deadly predators and harsh storms.

All your life you have known you were destined for greatness, as did the ancestor spirits of your tribe's great warriors. You owe your prowess in combat to the heroes whose blood flows in your veins. When you recover your strength in combat, these guardian spirits flash into sight for a moment, defending you from your enemies so that you can fight on.

The ancestral spirits that watch over you might represent any of the heroic classes of your people. The barbarian's strength drives the fury of your attacks, just as the shaman's wisdom inspires your tactics. However, in your determination to defend your allies and the world around you, you remain a warden through and through.

You raise your eyes and heart to the stars and to the spirit of the shining, winged serpents that helped tame the primordials. You have chosen the couatl as a spiritual ally, embracing that legendary creature's power so thoroughly that you assume its very form. You emulate your shining ally by rising above the battle with a flourish of power or by passing through your enemies like a radiant spirit.

Like couatls, you understand the necessity of sacrifice. The coils of your power can trap enemies that would otherwise harm your allies, but you must be willing to take those allies' hurts on yourself. If your own survival is jeopardized as you protect your friends, so be it.

Nature sleeps when winter falls, resting until the warmth of spring creeps across the land once more. Though forests grow quiet and few creatures stir, the warden's duty endures when the land is at its most vulnerable.

An icewrought sentinel harnesses winter's power for the world's defense. Whether you are drawn to this path through a natural affinity for wintry wastes or a spiritual connection to the season of darkness, your first step on the path to becoming an icewrought sentinel brings about changes in your body. Your flesh feels cool to the touch. Your eyes become a deep blue but turn frost-white when you are angry, and your lips and extremities take on a faint blue cast. When you use your warden evocations, snow swirls in the air around you as lines of frost form and quickly vanish on your skin.

This relationship is second nature to you—a way of life that helps you work with other hunters, combining all your skill to bring down even the deadliest quarry. By learning and applying the secrets of the first hunter, you have honed your warden powers for maximum efficiency with spears and other thrown weapons. Whether you fight from the front or strike from the side, your allies can rely on you.

If you finally become the prey, let your hunter beware. You walk with the spirits of ancestral hunters at your side, and foes that corner you will feel the bite of your weapon.

Regardless of the combat tricks you have learned during your adventuring career and the tactics with which you have surprised your enemies, a part of you yearns for direct and uncomplicated applications of might. The path of the earth shaker appeals to you because it matches strength to strength—your mastery of weapons augmented by the power of the earth beneath your feet, working together to oppose the raw might of dragons and behemoths, demons and deities.

The strength of earth that you draw on allows you to move through the ground at speed, even as your attacks bypass an opponent's armor to strike at the body within. Your connection to the natural world allows you to seek out targets behind obstacles or even within the ground, and your attacks can knock your foes down.

Leave the subtleties of strategy and complex tactics to others. Instead, you keep faith with the oldest spirits of rock and earth, letting their grim determination guide you in your mission to defend the world from forces that would despoil it.

The power of spring is in its ability to bring rebirth and hope. A warrior of spring wields this power to great effect, whether as a healer or a guardian of the primal world. As a shaman who follows this path, you are gifted with powers of primal healing beyond those of most other shamans. Your presence can allow allies to recover from the most grievous injury, or even from death itself.

Although you pride yourself in watching over your community, when adventure or the duty of a great cause calls, you are ready to act. You can heal your allies or instill hope in them, and the spirits you call on can help you defeat the greatest of threats.

As you go on adventures, your duty as a warrior of spring is clear. You carry a bundle of seeds gathered from across the lands. No matter what desolate realm you find yourself in, you're ready to scatter those seeds through it so that their verdant bounty can continue the cycle of spring.

Night follows day, winter follows summer, and death follows life. These are the basic truths of the primal world. For those who understand this fact and watch closely, Great Watcher provides inspiration and guidance, revealing omens of what is to come. Shamans who have the gifts of insight and prophecy often become great political or military leaders by using these talents wisely.

As a seasons' herald, you embrace the future, whether it's promising or dreadful. You don't shy away from ill omens. Accepting what lies ahead and having the determination to prepare for it form the bedrock of your beliefs.

You follow the path of adventure out of a sense of duty to your people and to the natural world. Looking into the future to prepare for the present, you seek out evil before it develops into a larger threat. As a wandering prophet or a simple helper, you travel to those places where you are most needed to maintain the natural order, whether doing so requires stopping war, ending a drought, or preventing unnatural creatures from entering the world through a planar breach.

The powerful magic you and your allies have mastered during your adventures can cure most nonfatal wounds, and even fatal wounds might be only temporary setbacks. Death is a solvable problem, and you are one of the most powerful healers that most people will encounter. Why, then, do you bear such terrible scars, as if you were a warrior who had suffered a terrible defeat?

In the history of your people, victories and defeats have always gone hand in hand. Your scars are marks of your status as one of the heroes who ensures that no defeat will be total. By accepting the painful lessons of the past and bearing their marks on your flesh, you access healing magic that other shamans can't or aren't willing to use.

The most powerful healing spirits of the world recognize your unique pattern of scars. When the world hangs in the balance, the power of these spirits is on your side.

Your eagle spirit companion has always talked with you, telling you secrets not spoken of by your watcher spirit mentors.

Other shamans' spirit companions have their own advantages, such as a knack for healing or a strong sense of nature. As a keen eagle shaman, you have a bloodthirsty spirit for a companion, and each new power you learn together has a primary purpose: wounding your foes. Your spirit companion guides the attacks of you and your allies, even at great distances, and uses a subtle turn of a wing or a slashing talon to put a foe in its most vulnerable position.

Shamans know that the spirits are not truly the size of a human, an elf, or a panther. The spirits are vast, small, or whatever they are called on to be by the world's needs. Shamans know this to be true, but not all shamans can master their unconscious expectations of the spirits. Each spirit companion appears as a creature of the shaman's size because of its link to the shaman, and as allies and friends, both share an image, a reflection, within the world of spirits.

You have seen partway through this veil. As a follower of the world speaker tradition, you know that your spirit companion is vast. By seeing part of this truth, you know that your spirit companion's size approaches that of an elder spirit, having a touch of the scope and power you will acquire if you live to fulfill an epic destiny.

As an elder spirit, your spirit companion protects your allies as it has always protected the people of the world. Its knowledge, allied with your understanding of nature, is sometimes the only shield your allies require.

When Everflame first sparked upon the world, it left behind fires that burned without fuel, stoked only by Everflame's essence. Guided by the spirits, shamans gathered these embers and tended to them. Even though Everflame originated outside the world, with time and careful tending by these Everflame guardians, its fires became part of the natural order.

As an Everflame guardian, you embrace two equal tasks. On one hand, you search for demons, devils, primordials, and other creatures that have intruded into the world, scouring them with the fiery might of Everflame. On the other hand, you seek to ensure that new life rises in the aftermath of great calamity. Whether a volcanic eruption destroys a region, a great fire burns a forest, or a legion of monsters disrupts the natural order, you seek to nurture the world back to health, believing that no force, not even Everflame itself, can extinguish hope or life.

Just as the gentlest wind stirs grains of sand when it travels, so too do disciples of the winds take an active role in the events and lives they come into contact with during their wanderings. As a disciple of the winds, you are a shaman of wind spirits, from the gentle breeze that brings summer's warmth to the ferocious storm that scours the land, ripping trees from the earth. You particularly honor Stormhawk, and that spirit's range of emotions and thirst for vengeance are the standard by which you measure your own actions.

Although you sometimes choose to commune with the spirits of the wind among the aeries of great mountains, you seek adventure wherever the winds carry you, embracing happenstance and luck as omens of the wind spirits. If you arrive at a castle besieged by giants, you gladly join the fight against the invaders, because the winds led you there to take part in events. Where the winds travel, you follow, and you are no mere observer.

As a druid who assumes swarm shapes, you have already mastered complex magic that maintains your identity even while you are dispersed in the form of many insects. Your new path focuses on gaining greater control of the individuals that compose your swarm forms. Most druids work with one swarm shape at a time, but you mix many different types of seeds, leaves, insects, and other natural things into a supremely flexible form, which adapts to any challenge. 

Many of your powers take advantage of the whirling wings of the seeds called samaras or the buzzing wings of insects. You can take f light as smoothly as you shift into beast form, then send pieces of yourself whirling among your allies to protect them from harm.

The might of primal storms—furious things of lightning, thunder, and rain—courses through your magic. Few druids walk the path of the storm speaker, for it is fraught with indomitable forces that can be channeled only temporarily, rather than truly controlled. The storm speaker dabbles with primal powers that dance and surge across the sky, free of all fetters.

Storm speakers seek out broad plains, the better to see and study storms that sweep across the sky. Their lodges are marked by tall spikes of iron marked with yellow and blue runes. During a storm, a speaker meditates within one of these lodges, allowing his or her mind to wander among the winds and rain. If the storms are open to sharing their secrets, bolts of lightning strike the iron spikes, sending waves of primal energy over the speaker, fortifying his or her power.

Many of the world's languages use words for “spirit” and “breath” that are related to each other. Whereas other primal magicians mostly consort with the spirits behind the world's creatures and things, you have befriended one of the ancient winds. The Spiral Wind carries the secrets of life in its twists; look at any humanoid fingerprint, and you'll see the spirals that mark where the wind entered to give the person life.

You have learned to call the Spiral Wind when you and your allies have need of its healing powers. You won't be mistaken for a cleric or a shaman, but your allies have learned that a sudden breeze might be a sign of your allied wind's arrival.

The Spiral Wind has more to do with the people of the wilderness than with the beasts, and you are more comfortable in humanoid form than in beast form. You can still change shape, but most of the powers and features that rely on the Spiral Wind work only when you are in your humanoid form.

Perhaps you were raised in the wilderness and learned to summon beasts to serve as your hunting companions. Perhaps your community needed protection, and you learned the ways of summoning animal guardians at a moment's notice. Or it could be that you grew up hearing the whispers of animal spirits and are a master at calling them to your side. Whatever your route to the path of the primal summoner, you seek a mastery over summoned beasts that other druids do not possess. Some of your abilities help your beasts act on their instincts, whereas other abilities help you command those beasts with even greater skill.

The primal slayer that you learn to control at the peak of your power is an ancient spirit. It might not be the most mighty creature you learn to summon, but its ability to change its shape echoes the versatility of your power.

When you take on the form of an insect swarm, the insects glow with supernatural light. The stories of your ancestors tell of luminescent insects in primeval times, insects that led your ancestors through swamps and forests to safety. These creatures had no kindness for the enemies of your tribe and used their hypnotic lights to lead enemies astray, drowning them in deep bogs and abandoning them in animal dens. You, too, are a protector and an ally when you take on the shape of the luminescent swarm.

Some druids keep their distance from serpentine beasts, but you recognize such creatures as being just as integral to the natural world as anything that has fur or feathers.

Your prowess is hardly a mystery to those who behold you. You hold a weapon in your right hand and another weapon in your left. You keep your inner self somewhat contained until battle begins. At that point, you hurl yourself against as many enemies as possible. The two weapons in your hands, projecting from your whirling arms, are the lethal claws of a great predator. The spirit pack trailing you growls with bloodlust and relishes the kill.

You cultivate the feral spirit of a great wolverine, a scytheclaw drake, an ancient tribal hero, or another vicious combatant. This spirit guides your path, finally manifesting through you when you have mastered the twinclaw berserker rage.

Many barbarians fight with the viciousness of a wild animal. Others draw strength from the violence of storms or the destructiveness of fire. You prefer a more steady source: the might of earth and stone. Although the earth endures in stillness, entire cities are destroyed when its anger is incited. You have studied the power of the earth and learned to incorporate it into your barbarian evocations. You combine the raging fury of magma with the patience of stone.

Stonefire ragers are common among dwarves and goliaths. They scale the greatest peaks of the world to commune with mountain spirits. Here and there, small monasteries stand atop mountains where stonefire ragers gather. At first glance, the warrior monks of these places seem to be simple ascetics. Woe to the villain that dares disturb their meditations.

From a young age, you studied the turning of the seasons and the relentless march of time. In the end, all things die. You embraced this truth, and in accepting the certainty of death, you found that it elicited no fear in you. Death is as common as the rain on your face or the wind through your hair. Why turn away from it like a frightened rabbit?

As a barbarian, death is your steady companion on the battlefield. Your profound acceptance of mortality and your mastery of primal magic combine to transform you into death's herald. You channel the fleeting passage of life and the inevitability of the grave through your mighty battle cries. Your mere presence on the battlefield is enough to drive the most superstitious of your enemies before you. As for the rest, they fall like wheat before the harvester's scythe.

In the past, you raged like any other barbarian. Then you learned the secret power that comes from being able to harness your fury. You now attain the furious clarity on the far side of rage. You walk a perfectly controlled sword's edge of lethal potential.

It might have been a specific catastrophe—a moment when you had spent yourself in savagery and could not respond to a new and greater threat—that showed you the way to a higher plane of rage. Or you might have felt a call to a deeper understanding of rage, one that eludes other barbarians.

You have the spirit and the understanding of an elder. You are able to look beyond the next few bloody moments toward what might be best for the future. The primal spirits you call on are wise and strong. They share with you a broad perspective, the knowledge that controlled fury can be stronger than rage without restraint.

As you have grown in power, the thunder spirits riding on your war cries have amassed strength of their own. When your weapon strikes true, the spirits pour from you in an unrivaled storm, smashing enemies who might have shrugged off your physical blows or the war cries of a lesser thunderborn barbarian.

Like a great storm piling thunderheads higher and darker, you gather strength as you fight battles and suffer wounds. More conservative warriors hold back or retreat when their wounds accumulate, whereas you reach your peak when your reserves are close to their end.

When the storm finally breaks, your voice calls the lightning as well as the thunder spirits. You master the full arsenal of the storm.

Elders tell stories to the young about the days when honored ancestors roamed the land. According to the stories, these forebears were a breed apart: stronger, wiser, and more attuned to the virtues of the spirit way than the people of today are. The ancestors' spirits do little to discourage such tales. It's good to be remembered fondly and respectfully, so that young people will heed ancient lessons. Eventually, the young grow up and learn that people throughout history have largely been the same.

You are exceptional, however—one of those who truly is a breed apart. You are a mighty slayer, a champion who can keep a community alive through the worst of times. You can inspire your people to take on fights they normally couldn't win, and your bravery might make you a hero for the ages.

Ancestral spirits have marked you as their chosen warrior, so they remain close to you. If they can help keep you alive, everyone benefits. If you fall, they'll be on hand to welcome you into their ancestral war band.

Spirits are everywhere in the world, from haunted forests to windswept mountains. These entities can be nothing more than wild emotions given half-realized form or can possess vast intelligence, with memories stretching back to the world's earliest days. You turn to these spirits to help you protect the world, drawing from their vast and mysterious power to glimpse your enemies' fates and bring about their final ends.

Communing with the land's spirits reveals possible futures, from which you pluck the strands of fate that coincide best with your travels, and you weave those strands into your bowstring. Arrows fired from the bow carry with them the fates your enemies deserve.

This paragon path is one of guardianship. Just as you can harry enemies by loosing spirits at them, so too can you alter the fates of those around you. These techniques help keep your allies from harm, even as you frustrate and confound your foes.

The spirits demand recompense for crimes committed against the natural world, and they accept payment only in blood. You are their collector. You range the land to exact the price your enemies must pay for violating the world. You are a relentless hunter, ruthless in your mien, and efficient in your methods.

The spirits aid you in your efforts by imparting to you the ancient hunting methods of your people. Though your ancestors used these techniques to bring down game, you find them equally effective in eliminating your foes. Each time an enemy falls, you reaffirm your bond to your spirit guides, offering the fallen enemy as a sacrifice to slake their thirst until you next come upon a deserving foe.

As a crimson hunter, you focus on the striker elements found in many seeker evocations. The smell of blood provokes you, letting you move more quickly to engage your enemies. These techniques allow you to close the distance to bring an enemy in range or to skirt the battlefield for your next strike.

With a gesture, you can craft a shadowblade, a weapon of pure darkness that is as sharp as any blade of steel. As long as a shadow is near you, you are never unarmed.

With your shadowblade, you can slice the raw stuff of a foe's shadow. With each cut, you extract part of that essence, and at a foe's death you can infuse that shadow with a magical effect. At your command, the shadows you have harvested appear as looming shades to distract a foe, swirl around you to shield you from sight, or reach forth like hungry apparitions to douse torches and lanterns.

You are a hunting phantom, an assassin who excels at using shadow magic to slip past the tightest defenses. Once you have chosen to slay a creature, no barrier can prevent you from reaching it.
	
This assassin's tradition traces its origin to the Obsidian Cave assassins' guild, an ancient dwarven order that specialized in hunting down and killing Underdark monsters. Initiates of the Obsidian Cave were tasked with finding and killing mind flayers, drow priestesses, and others that sought to attack the surface world. With such preventative attacks, the dwarves ensured that their mines remained safe. Since that time, the hunting phantom's techniques have passed to assassins from different traditions.

Githzerai strive for inner harmony, a blending of physical capacities, knowledge, and strength of the soul. They use a variety of methods to acquire this enlightenment. Among these is a cycle of quieting the mind and then returning to physical activity. 

A major aspect of the process is meditation. When the mind is allowed to naturally become still in meditation, it transcends normal mental boundaries and leaves the ego behind for blissful silence. Githzerai refer to tapping this transcendent silence as “knowing oneself.” To them, this is like allowing a field to remain fallow for a season, allowing it to retain and build up the nutrients it would otherwise give away. 

Returning to physical responsibilities and focused training plants seeds in the healthier soil. The body grows more in tune with the mind and the soul. Because it is nurtured in all aspects, the whole organism grows stronger. 
Work and rest in such cycles bears fruit for the devotee in greater skill, greater peace of mind, and greater accord with the outer world. It is this connection of inner self and outer world that storvakals attempt to master. The storvakal has reached a milestone of personal development such that he or she can command nearby forces and expect a positive response. The storvakal's personal being also responds to adversity more like water flowing around a hammer than a stone struck by the same instrument. Githzerai refer to this state of being as “support of nature,” which garners any githzerai who has it great respect. 

Such harmony and respect is yours, for your dedication has placed you on the path of the storvakal. Your serenity mixes with your formidable powers to defend you and give you focus, as well as to support your allies. Adversaries mistake your lack of histrionics for weakness at their peril. Your calm is that of the alpine lake, deep and inscrutable. Their own emotions and lack of commitment give you inroads to manipulate and defeat them.

From now on, the world around you will reorder itself to your needs in ways small and great. Minor fortunate events that seem like luck to others will prove your inner and outer accord. The limit to this support of nature is yours to determine with your dedication and deeds. As it grows, so shall your ability to accomplish anything toward which you bend your will.

The titanic struggle between Bahamut and Tiamat is legendary. Throughout history, the two gods have clashed, their armies mustering and throwing themselves against each other repeatedly as the two powers struggle for dominance. No matter the other interests guiding them or their involvement in the natural world, their longstanding animosity inevitably comes to the fore. Many champions fighting for the Platinum Dragon identify this endless conflict and come to see Tiamat as evil's author in the world. Those who do might take the battle to Tiamat's followers, committing themselves to rooting out and destroying her dragons and other servants. As a Chromatic Bane, you devote your training and purpose to the destruction of evil dragons. Metallic or chromatic, planar or otherwise, if the dragon is sworn to the Lady of Avarice, it becomes your sworn enemy. You hone your fighting techniques to withstand draconic fury and develop ways to lend aid to comrades who fight at your side. When you master your style, you become Tiamat's bane, a relentless adversary opposing her designs on every front.

You were a terrible student. Wild and unpredictable, no lesson stuck with you. No matter how hard you tried, you'd  revert back to your old reckless ways. Your problem might have come from a life among savage and warlike  people, or you could just havea nasty temper. In either case, your time at the war college was brief when it was  clear the instructors had nothing to teach you. In your adventures since, you have learned to channel your wrath into your attacks. When you look back on the stodgy lessons and unbearable drills, you laugh because you have learned a better way to kill.

Blessed with keen reflexes and stunning speed, you never developed a taste for heavy armor and cumbersome weaponry. You felt it was far more effective to dispense with the weighty gear so that you could stay fast on your feet, dance around your opponents, and deliver swift strikes every bit as nasty as a single blow from a greataxe. Other fighters might scoff at your thin rapier and your parrying dagger, but you wipe their smiles off their faces when you duck beneath their attacks and stick your blades in gaps between their armor.

You are a master tinker and can create construct familiars of such perfection that they are scarcely distinguishable from living creatures. Essentially homunculi, your familiars incorporate a tiny portion of your own life energy, distilled into a drop of your blood. This life link allows you to feel your familiar's pain and drives you to keep it safe and make it stronger. Others might think you strange because you spend so much time with your creations, but they don't understand: These are your children. Your path features all relate to your familiar, and your powers work only if your familiar is in active mode. Since it's important that your familiar stick around if you want to make full use of it, take some familiar feats to increase its defenses and to gain other benefits.

Demons clamber and claw to violate the natural world, while wicked devils seduce and mislead mortals, binding their souls in unspeakable contracts. Shapechangers and aberrants hide in plain sight, concealing their hideous appearances and horrible agendas behind pleasant masks.

Mortals must be warned against this growing corruption must be shown their errors so they can repent and offer prayers and strength to the gods.

Although arcanists might wield their power in different ways, all tap into the same source. By studying the techniques of other arcane classes, you discover commonalities between them all. Rather than seeing a wizard's esoteric formulas as obstacles, you learn ways around the complex mechanisms that allow you to duplicate their spells. Likewise, you find new ways to harness power in ways similar to sorcerers even though it does not well from within you. You can hurl fireballs, assemble magical servants, call forth dread magic from within, or siphon power from otherworldly beings all though the normal routines you perform with your bard spells. Armed with this new knowledge, nothing is beyond your capabilities. 

As a resourceful magician, you manipulate arcane energy in its fundamental state. You derive even greater benefits from your diverse studies to let you better emulate other arcane class features. You also find it easier to employ arcane spells, using your power more judiciously so no spell is wasted. You might not have the raw destructive potential a sorcerer enjoys or experience the fruits of a wizard's discipline, but you do have an extensive knowledge of magic in all its myriad forms, giving you an edge when you need it most.

The myths told and retold by the people of the world have power, changing the past even as they shape the future. Warriors gather around fires to swap tales about the Great Bear and the World Serpent, while shamans whisper portents revealed to them by the Fate Weaver to any who will listen. Though such stories live large in those who revere the oral tradition of storytelling, they are not guarded, not secret, and any who would listen and learn from them can touch their great power.

As a mythic skald, you may have spent your life among a primal tribe, living beyond the civilized lands and there kept your people's traditions alive. You might have served as an advisor to your chieftain or even fought alongside your fellow warriors, filling them with courage through your tales. Regardless, you use arcane magic to bring the ancient tales to life, filling your companions with glorious visions and unrivaled courage, revealing the deeper meanings in the legends you have picked up during your travels.

In the right hands, a blade is every bit the instrument a mandolin can be. As a bard, your ability to perform, to captivate audiences with song or story, is key. Through your tales or music, allies find new inspiration, while enemies find despair. You can clarify situations with your bold insights or muddy your foes' senses with mocking wit and subterfuge. Just as this is possible through a bard's music, so it is possible through other venues of performance.

Rather than spend your time on dusty old tales or mastering a complex instrument, you focus on the performance with a blade. Your precise stances and a perfect execution of your fighting style's forms, combined with a dash of improvisation, elevate the grim business of combat to an impressive display of physical mastery and fighting technique. Through it all, you harry your foes with dazzling swordplay and razor sharp wit.

Upon embarking on this path, you incorporate martial techniques into your spells, blending the two into a fighting style unique to you. Your forceful personality proves every bit as strong as the musclebound fighter and as quick as the most nimble rogue. Through your incessant mocking, your opponents let down their guard long enough for you to slip in a devastating attack. Your weapon is a blur, focusing on showmanship and speed to dishearten your enemies, while at the same time inspiring your allies to new heights of combat prowess.

The Astral Sea resounds with music, from the glorious choruses of angels to the grim chants intoned by legion devils marching to war. Bards weave arcane magic into mundane songs and music, but those who listen, who hear the wondrous music found only in the Astral Sea, can add its unique qualities to their own melodies, blending arcane with divine into a harmonious performance that can move the hardest of hearts. Few have the courage or belief required, making the blessed psalmist an uncommon curiosity within the bardic tradition.

The moment you first heard the astral notes, it was as if a door in your mind opened. New possibilities flooded your thoughts, impelling you to refocus your study on religious theory and history to blend the heavenly music with your own. Extensive training paid off: You mastered the music and can now incorporate it into your songs. Arcane power remains your brush, but the divine is your paint, and the two combine as a perfect portrait of your unequalled mastery over two worlds.

Your spells assume a divine quality, and you shine with astral light when you attend to your allies. Radiant flames might dance about you when you intone prayers you learn, while otherworldly entities add their voices to your own when you perform. You transcend what is ordinarily possible with arcane power and successfully blend it with that of the gods.

Untold years of slavery shaped your people. Freedom molded them further during the split from those who became the githyanki. In the centuries since the githzerai gained independence, they have struggled to master themselves and prepared themselves against any threat to the liberty they earned so long ago. They shall not be enslaved again.

Defense is not enough, however. Your people have always formed war bands to deal with menaces close and far. Highest among these is a rrakkma, a vengeance band. In these elite cadres, a mighty few—called rrathmals—gather together and venture forth to hunt those who still watch the free githzerai with covetous eyes. Each rrakkma sets out on a hunt, bringing destruction to mind flayers, githyanki, and other threats wherever they are found.

At times, a rrakkma has a specific goal, such as hindering githyanki plans of conquest or ferreting out a hive of mind flayers. Other rrakkmas wander until they have faced a number of foes sufficient to call the mission a success. To serve in a rrakkma is a great privilege, and githzerai preparing to join such a group receive special training. Even a githzerai who has proven worthy while traveling among nongithze-rai might be so honored.

You are such a one. You have served your people well, proven yourself worthy of special training, or found a teacher who knows the techniques of the vengeance warriors of the githzerai. Rrathmals have a variety of abilities, but each of them can make assaults decisively, pursue enemies relentlessly, and defeat foes utterly

As is always true among the githzerai, what you do with your power is up to you. The expectation is only that you use your rrathmal training to the best of your ability to protect yourself, your people, and your companions. With it, you'll continue to prove yourself among the greatest of your people. You'll write yourself into the chronicles of the githzerai and into the nightmares of those who invite your vengeful hand.

An uncarnate's ultimate goal is to become a being of pure mind, unbound by the limits of corporeality. “The flesh is weak, but the mind is strong” is an aphorism among many psions, but uncarnates take it as their guiding truth. They seek to become discarnate, to grow into creatures of pure thought held together by psionic will.

Uncarnates don't seek the paths of undeath that some arcanists choose. Though uncarnates using their abilities are sometimes mistaken for wraithlike spirits, such spirits are bound by the chill chains of undeath, not the self-generated will of psionic might.

You set yourself possibly the greatest psionic challenge: to maintain the clarity and power of your mind as you slowly work at forgetting the flesh that supports it. In the end, it's only the mind that matters.

An order of protectors called the Keepers of the Cerulean Sign formed long ago to face the threat of the Far Realm's collision with reality. The keepers achieved a great victory and fenced out an invading sovereignty of madness behind potent seals. But as often happens, without an imminent threat to face, the protectors slowly faded from history, and their most potent weapons, artifacts known as the Seven Cerulean Seals (also called the Seven Keys), were lost or destroyed.

But the Far Realm remains. Its presence is a barb in reality's side. Some say psionic power itself is the world's answer to the Far Realm. Just as a body unconsciously fights off sickness, the universe prepares for some future battle by sowing psionic potential among its denizens.

Your psionic ability alerted you to the growing aberrant threat at a young age. Despite being a psionic weapon against aberrant spawn, you sought out even more potent weapons. While in the depths of a psionic trance, you glimpsed the original Cerulean Seals. There is little hope of recovering them, but you formed an image of them in your mind and created a copy. Like one of the seals, your copy—a Cerulean Sign—consists of a stylized white tree on a sky-blue background. Though imperfect, it is enough to empower you. You have taken up the sign and pledged yourself to the world's defense.

The undead that crawl out of the earth and shamble from chill barrows are an unnatural blight upon the land. You have taken up the charge of destroying these horrors with the brilliant light of your faith. The undead are no longer the people they once were, and sending them back to their graves is the only way to respect those whose corpses walk again in undeath.

You were appointed to your holy task after undergoing sacred rituals and learning ancient prayers that invest you with the power to eradicate the walking dead. This paragon path is well suited to followers of Pelor, god of the sun and enemy of the creatures of darkness. Paladins of Ioun too are dedicated to foiling the plans of Vecna, who is the god of undeath as well as the keeper of foul secrets. However, many deities encourage their followers to dispatch the undead as violations of divine law, so slayer traditions are strong among the devotees of many gods.

The core of your values and the code you follow are rooted in your willingness to give your life for a greater purpose. Your body and soul are strong, and you do not shrink from giving up some of that strength to help others. You strike out with divine fury that racks you with pain but imbues you with even greater strength. You measure your worth by the foes you defeat.

As a scion of sacrifice, you are zealous in the extreme, eager to meet the enemies of your faith regardless of the circumstances. When others pause and deliberate, you act—for better or for worse. However, you are not suicidal. If you encounter a foe clearly beyond your ability to defeat, you retreat to work toward the day when your power matches the enemy's. Or you might turn aside to aid companions who are in danger, or withdraw to carry the injured away from battle. But in most fights you are grim and fearless. Whether you fall in the effort to defeat a mighty foe or survive to face a new threat tomorrow lies in the hands of your god.

You have sworn a sacred vow to pursue a great quest that has challenged the devotion of divine champions for centuries.

As a questing knight, you must meet your god's demanding standards to prove yourself worthy of success. Depending on the nature of your deity, you might have to demonstrate outstanding courage, perseverance, humility, indomitability, wisdom, honor, fury, or piety. The object of the quest could be a lost relic, a hidden oracle, the words of a holy verse now forgotten, the destruction of an artifact inimical to your god, or the defeat of a legendary foe.

Because the trail leading to your ultimate goal sometimes grows cold, you need not abandon your current concerns entirely. Continue with your adventures, and strive to be the best you can be, but watch carefully for signs and portents that lead you onward in your quest.

Devils scheme amid the layers of the Nine Hells and infest the world with evil. You are sworn to protect innocents from their infernal machinations. To this end, you have joined an order of like-minded warriors.

The Knights of the Chalice take their order's name from an artifact belonging to the deity slain by Asmodeus when he ascended to godhood. It is rumored that with a single draught of water from the chalice of that deity, the drinker can atone for any wrong and completely purify his or her soul. Some say that drinking from the cup can turn any being, even Asmodeus himself, from evil to good. Whether or not these tales of these legendary properties are true, the chalice is undoubtedly a powerful artifact for good, and many Knights of the Chalice seek it. Some pursue a loftier goal still: to resurrect the chalice's divine owner and restore him to his throne.

As a Knight of the Chalice, you remain vigilant for any signs of infernal activity. You aid all of good heart who stand in the path of devilish influence, and you answer the call of your fellow knights when the powers of the Nine Hells gather in force.

You are a divine warrior in service to a deity of order and righteousness, looking beyond the immediate threat of evil to its source. You set mighty goals of triumph, such as the overthrow of a terrible tyrant or the fall of a nation of villains, to tear power from your deity's enemies and give it to the deserving. You have no interest in possessing a territory and seek to preserve governance by virtuous rulers.

You are single-minded in your pursuit of a goal and go to almost any length to achieve it, and you are better suited to the role of a frontline soldier than a leader. You prefer to charge into battle, using ardent vow to smite your foes. You have little patience for negotiation and can be impulsive to a fault.

Holy conquerors often worship Bahamut, Kord, or Pelor, glorifying their god with each victory in battle. Many have strong connections to specific locations that were seized in battle or that hold particular religious significance.

As a devotee of Moradin, you have dedicated yourself to the destruction of your god's traditional enemies and the protection of his faith. In return for your dedication, Moradin lends strength to your hand and shields you with his power. In some lands, hammers of Moradin form an elite knightly order of clerics and paladins who defend dwarven citadels. Others are solitary agents of order who use their powers to protect the weak and confront injustice wherever they encounter it.

Although many hammers of Moradin are dwarves, any hero who wields Moradin's divine power is free to choose this path. Champions of many races turn to Moradin for the strength to hold back evil and defeat the wicked. Human knights, eladrin swordsmiths, and dragonborn battle-priests are all numbered among the hammers of Moradin.

As a paladin, you cleave to principles that guide you through life, shaping your worldview and forming your moral foundation. Even if you don't follow a code of behavior, you follow the precepts of your god and work to live up to your faith's expectations. Yet the enemy never plays fair. Sometimes rules must be bent, or even broken, for the greater good.

No one knows this better than you, a gray guard. You have made a career of defying expectations and making the tough choices that your peers avoid. For you, the ends justify the means—even stealing, lying, or brutal interrogation. You do what you must to defeat the enemy. Your tactics don't make you popular with others in service to your god. Many see you as dangerous, almost as much of a threat as your enemies. Let them say what they will. You know that, deep down, they fear you and might even respect you.

As you continue down this path, you might feel estranged from your god, a disappointment to the one for whom you have sacrificed so much. The blood staining your hands has somehow darkened your soul, although your abilities are unaffected. But you do what you must.

You are a living bulwark, protecting the defenseless. You are the shelter in the storm. As a faithful shield, you place your companions' well-being above your own.

Faithful shields are supreme examples of devout warriors, found in most of the world's faiths. Such warriors safeguard holy sites and divine servants. Others set out into the world to lend their talents to those who need it most, whether the folk of a frontier town surrounded by enemies or a band of adventurers working to thwart a dire threat.

Rather than focusing on dealing damage, you give your companions the time they need to win through. You might partner with another defender, forming an impregnable wall, or work with a trusted striker, blocking enemy attacks and creating openings for your ally. When your group is hard pressed, you might cover the retreat, slowly giving ground while your friends flee to safety.

A champion must fight many monsters, and the most savage and ferocious of these are dragons. They sport a daunting arsenal of claws, fangs, stings, roars, and breath weapons, and they are protected by iron-hard scales and supernatural vitality. Many also have a wicked, calculating intelligence. Few warriors stand a chance against such foes, but you have made it your duty to protect defenseless folk against their depredations. You seek out all destructive monsters—including other fantastic beasts such as manticores, wyverns, and sphinxes—and put an end to their reigns of terror.

You might be a hunter of some skill, but you do not rely on patient stalking, trap-setting, or sudden ambush to defeat your sworn enemies. You meet monsters openly in chivalrous combat, pitting your skill and courage against fiery breath and flashing fang. It's a fair fight.

Embodiments of chaos and cruelty, demons are an affront to your faith, and you seek to destroy them at every opportunity. You have received special blessings and learned battle prayers that are anathema to the denizens of the Abyss. Your attacks pierce their unholy defenses, and simply being near you causes them pain. You won't rest until every demon is dead.

All but the darkest and most vile of gods regard demons as a blight upon the cosmos and urge their followers to root out demonic threats wherever they appear. Most well-organized faiths support orders devoted to confronting demons; some anoint demonslayers from among the ranks of the faithful using ancient rituals.

A knight of the eladrin courts, you are pledged to the service of the lords of the fey. Along with valor and martial skill, you have shown exceptional patience, grace, and compassion—qualities admired in eladrin and elven realms alike. You follow a personal code that resembles the chivalric traditions of the mortal world, but you bring a fey perspective to the concepts of honor, valor, and fidelity. Most knights are obligated to prove their bravery by declining advantages that reduce risk in battle, but you do not scorn the bow, the spell, or the ruse of war when such tactics are effective. You have learned techniques for making the best use of agility and quickness even while wearing the heaviest armor.

Among the eladrin, those who follow this path are known as the Aelavellin Seldarine—the Sword Knights of the Seldarine. Most such champions are eladrin, elves, or half-elves, for Corellon is the patron of these peoples. However, any noble warrior devoted to the lord of the Seldarine can become a champion of Corellon. Those champions of Corellon who are of other races find a warm welcome in most eladrin and elven communities and are usually regarded as ruathar (“star-friends”), honored allies.

To strengthen you for the hardships that lie ahead, you have been given a rare blessing: You have drunk a single drop of ichor, the blood of the gods. The potency of ichor is more than the mortal frame was meant to bear, and the effect of consuming even a drop was almost enough to kill you. But you survived, and now a tiny portion of immortal blood flows through your veins.

Ichor is exceedingly rare in the world. Secretive religious orders carefully hoard vials containing the silvery substance, concealing it in well-defended temples, remote monasteries, or hidden shrines. You might have discovered the drop you consumed in along-forgotten vault years ago and carried the vial until you grew powerful enough to drink its contents and live. Or emissaries of those who first schooled you in the invoker's way might have arrived when you were ready to take this path, bringing you the drop of ichor. In any event, your goal as a vessel of ichor is to defend the great and noble things the gods have created against those who would tear them down. Whenever a servant of the gods is murdered, whenever something sacred is defiled, it is an affront to divine sovereignty.

You are an initiate in a rare tradition, one that embraces a unified religious concept summed up in one word of power. The Word was crafted by the gods to be a great weapon. Only the most trustworthy and compassionate invokers are taught the syllables of the Word, and even they seldom use its power. Each syllable, when spoken in the proper pitch and cadence, is a powerful prayer in its own right, and those brief tones are the most powerful weapons of your faith.

It is not enough simply to repeat the syllables that comprise the Word; to unleash its power you must desire to do so, speaking it exactly and framing the philosophical significance of each syllable in your mind as you say it. Uttering the Word unleashes dangerous divine energy, and even speakers of the Word dare not utter it in a voice louder than a whisper.

Ancient scrolls speak of the world's last days, foretelling a time of violence and destruction that will consume everything. You have studied these scrolls and know the disasters destined to befall the world: nine terrible catastrophes that will one day cause its doom. These supernatural disasters were sown in the world's foundations during the first days and now lie buried beneath mighty seals in its far corners. It is your task to ensure that these seals remain intact, for each time some evil power breaks one, the end of all things draws closer. Those who meddle with the seals flirt with the destruction of all and risk upsetting the great purpose of the cosmos.

To safeguard the ancient seals, you are initiated into a secretive order: the Keepers of the Nine. You learn powerful prayers of warding and destruction so that you can deal with those who meddle with forces they do not understand. Keepers are drawn from many races and include servants of different gods, but most are dedicated to Erathis, Ioun, or Moradin. Old disagreements and jealousies are common among the Keepers, but all agree that the Nine Seals must remain hidden and unbroken.

A paragon of scholarship, you wield the power of knowledge. You believe that the gods are the ultimate vessels of wisdom in the universe, and through devotion to them and careful study of their words, you seek to understand and shape reality itself.

Divine philosophers generally arise from remote monasteries where the words of the gods are studied and debated amid daily chants and meditations. A rare few divine philosophers are self-taught savants, who learn through careful study of divine texts and personal devotion to the gods. Whatever their origins, divine philosophers seek knowledge throughout the world, in temple archives, hidden vaults, and ancient libraries.
As a divine philosopher, you call on your deep understanding of the gods to aid you in your adventures. Your tireless pursuit of knowledge leads you across the planes to ancient civilizations and hostile lands. Although you might serve a particular deity, you seek the wisdom of all the gods, wherever it can be found.

Through faithful devotion, you have attracted the attention of your deity, who has elevated you as a divine hand. A mortal representative of your deity, you have a divine mission, such as to construct a great monument in your god's image, to subdue a tyrant, or to create a temple in a distant land. Your actions sometimes seem without purpose, but they are part of your deity's grand design. Many divine hands are marked physically by their god in the form of unusual eye or hair color or a blemish on the skin.

As a divine hand, you wield powerful invocations for smiting the enemies of your deity. You are a dauntless soldier for your cause, because your fervor fills your heart with limitless courage. Your great faith strikes fear into your enemies and blazes a bright path across the world.

You are a messenger of the gods and a preacher of divine virtues. Your speech evokes devotion in the faithful and fear in the irreligious. You are an authority for anyone wishing to know the desires of your deity, and you are renowned for your power to enhance and amplify your voice and for your ability to speak in ominous, multilayered tones.

A few devoted orators are trained at temples, but most arise through private devotion. You might have communed directly with a deity and been forever moved by the experience, or you could be one whose faith is strong enough to bridge the mortal and immortal. People who dislike your message might regard you as a scolder, a rabble-rouser, or a threat to the established order, but you have little concern for how they react to you; you speak what the gods put in your heart, and you trust that they will deal harshly with those who ignore you or hinder you in your mission. If you serve a temple, you often prove to be difficult for your superiors to deal with, since your pronouncements chastise the great and the powerful as well as the rest of the people. Consequently, you rarely stay in one place for long. A few theocracies have devoted orators at their head or in close service to the ruler, for few dare to refute the power of one such as you.

You are an agent of justice to your deity's enemies. You are judge, jury, and executioner, although you are more than an inflicter of punishment. You are also a redresser of wrongs and a giver of absolution, enjoined to aid those who have been unfairly treated and to set injustices aright. According to longstanding tradition, you conceal your features beneath a crimson mask or hood while you perform your duties. By this sign the condemned and the forgiven alike know that you are acting not from your mortal passions or preferences, but as your divine master instructs. Crimson arbiters are most likely to serve deities concerned with law or justice, such as Erathis, Bahamut, Pelor, or Bane.

You carry small strips of paper marked with sacred glyphs that lend strength to your prayers for justice. Each holds the name of a power epitomizing mercy, perception, balance, or punishment, guiding you in your judgments.

The words of creation can bend the elements to your desires, but the words of mortal speech also have power to create or destroy. Far better to listen instead of speak, to seek the wisdom that comes with quiet understanding. You speak sparingly and softly, and you choose your words with great care.

Deception worms its way through the world, corroding morals and subverting ideals. Only through constant vigilance can this welling corruption be checked. Many divine servants battle obvious foes—undead, demons, and other foul creatures—but the enemies you face are far more insidious. You explore realms of shadow and deception, leading the fight against enemies who use guile instead of brutality.

To combat such forces, you armor yourself in the truth, using its radiance to burn away the lies and falsehoods your foes employ. In your presence, the enemy cannot hide or use its tricks, and it stands exposed before you.

Facing the worst sort of villains leaves its mark on you. You age prematurely, lines creasing your face, but such ravages of the body do not extend to your spirit. Each victory only firms your resolve. When you wield your truthseeker powers in the name of your god, your voice sounds like thunder and your enemies quail before your righteous presence.

Dwarves have long memories. They strengthen their recollections by retelling stories passed down since the dark days of their enslavement to giants. Preserving these tales is the responsibility of the stone keepers, dwarves chosen for their wisdom and commitment to history. These stone fathers and mothers, as they are sometimes called, chisel stories into shrine walls and temple domes to give their history a physical presence, making them part of the architecture and wonder of dwarven cities.

As a stone keeper, you concern yourself with the past, but you are not simply a scholar. You are a holy champion who draws strength from your fury over all the wrongs ever committed against your people, bringing it to bear against foes who still threaten your race. When dwarven strongholds are in danger, you are the first to unite the clans against the enemy. You also travel widely, visiting ruined dwarven kingdoms and city-states to learn their fates and to exact vengeance when it is deserved.

Your views and beliefs encompass all of history and the place your people occupy in it. You harbor a deep-seated, smoldering anger born of ancient wrongs and long centuries of grief. Your prayers focus this anger into your attacks.

The Seldarine, the fellowship of brothers and sisters of the woods, comprises Corellon, Sehanine, and the other gods and exarchs who dwell in the dominion of Arvandor. Revered by elves and eladrin alike, these gods watch over and protect their favored scions. Elf and eladrin clerics often worship one or another of the Seldarine, but a few pay homage to the whole, drawing their power from Arvandor's combined wisdom.

As a Seldarine dedicate, you occupy a high position within your temples. You and the few others like you enjoy a broader connection to the gods of Arvandor than other clerics do, and you know methods for communing with them. You draw a bow as readily as you raise your holy symbol to focus your prayers.

Your weapon is inscribed with sigils and runes, which flare with emerald light when you fire a shot with a whispered prayer.

You've always had a knack for the healing arts. People just seem to recover more quickly under your care: Bones knit and cuts mend quickly, and even sickness flees your touch. As your mastery of divine power has strengthened, so too have your skills at tending the sick and injured. Now life energy flows through your fingertips to anyone you attend.

More than other clerics, you commit your life to alleviating suffering in any form. When you are not adventuring, you might work in the temples of any god and lend your talents to help the community, whether supplying food to the hungry or removing sickness from the afflicted. You bring these same sensibilities to an adventuring group. You move across the battlefield to shore up weakness and patch up the wounded so they can get back into the fight. You might not directly share in the glory enjoyed by your companions, but you take heart in knowing that they couldn't have done it without you.

You grieve for the so-called civilized races, too many of whom are locked in useless, never-ending strife. Unless some brave soul steps forward to set a better example, constant warfare can only create more conflict. Thus you have laid down your weapons and spoken vows of nonviolence, hoping to find a civilized solution to the problems of mortals.

As a messenger of peace, you always work to find a way around combat when battle is avoidable. Diplomacy is your principal weapon: Through carefully chosen words and accurate assessments of your opponent's desires, you might be able to circumvent conflict altogether. Not all enemies are willing to set aside their anger, though. Should battle erupt despite your best efforts, you are an eye of calm in war's hurricane. The weak, the weary, and the sorely wounded find succor in your presence.

You are a herald of the gods, imbued with divine will. Wherever you travel, you announce the intentions and desires of your patron. Your actions, words, and beliefs are windows into the gods' dominions, and through them shines the divine presence.

Although you serve a single deity, you enjoy a special connection with all divine powers, allowing them to subtly influence you and those around you. You might even be moved to prophesy from time to time. Some devotees of your faith might distrust this relationship; although they too honor all the gods, they take pride in their service to a single deity.

Whenever you speak in Supernal or utter your prayers, a tongue of fire appears over your head. The flame does not burn and sheds only the faintest light, but it does identify your special status.

Swords and spells can hold off enemies for a time, but still the best and bravest heroes fall to opposing forces. Thus, you have dedicated all your spirit to healing heroes' injuries and sustaining their efforts. You are a master of healing, and you are not afraid to give freely of your own strength and life to aid your companions.

Even more than your fellow heroes, you willingly risk yourself so that others might live, inspiring your comrades to daring acts of courage. You are not suicidal; you're just committed to your cause. Every wound you suffer spares another champion to fight on in the name of your god and beliefs. Death elicits no fear in you; your reward waits in the hereafter.

When evil bubbles up from the Abyss and spills into the world, when insane hordes raid and plunder civilized lands, or when lawlessness threatens society, you fight back to preserve the world. You shoulder this burden willingly, but you can lighten the load by uniting your companions behind your holy mission. You lead through your inspiring presence, wise words, and brave deeds, with the goal of one day ushering your allies to the glory that awaits bold champions of your faith.

You are a soldier of your god, but not a proselytizer. All deities and their servants have a place in the world. Your role is to unite disparate beliefs and achieve a common victory. Your tolerance, however, does not extend to those agents of ruin who would subvert your harmonious message with their ambition and greed.

When you sing hymns and recite scripture in battle, a silver halo appears above your head as a symbol of your belief and divine blessing. Its light fills your comrades with hope and purpose, helping them to rise above the mundane and seize their destinies.

In times long past, when the gods warred with the primordials, the divine armies were arrayed in majestic regalia blessed by angelic armorers with powerful wards against their foes. By long study of holy texts, you have learned those ancient prayers and rites.

As an anointed champion, you ward yourself against your foes by sanctifying the arms and armor you bear into battle with sacred oil and special ceremonies. You speak prayers that have not been heard by mortals for centuries, conferring the ancient blessings upon your companions as well. As you perform your holy tasks, you can feel the pull of history urging you on to the same glory the armies of the gods knew as they bested their enemies in ages past.

You are a servant of a deity of luck, and you completely trust your own good fortune. As a symbol of your devotion to chance, you always carry a set of dice with you. When in doubt, you trust the dice to determine your actions. Just like the wind, you can be gentle and complacent or a dangerous storm capable of destroying those who stand in your way. Although you are always unpredictable, you can be a brave and loyal companion; fortune brought your company together, after all, and you know better than most that great deeds often flow from unlikely friendships or chance meetings.

You are probably a worshiper of Avandra or a similar deity. Your purpose is to inspire people to be daring, to take chances and seize opportunities, for those who take no risks never realize their full potential. In battle, you have learned to rely on chance. You are a potent combatant when luck favors you.
Although you might not represent the typical image of a divine servant, you are nonetheless a faithful devotee of your deity and your beliefs. You have little regard for the strictures of formal worship—you're more likely to be found gambling in a tavern than praying in a temple. But when chance leads you to down the path to adventure or into a situation that demands action, you don't hesitate to join the fight. After all, that's what's the dice told you to do.

Hidden orders and secret ceremonies of initiation are the way for many avengers, but you have come to embrace a simpler tradition. You are a protector of the common folk who hides in plain sight. With a quiet manner and thoughtful devotion, you are a steward of the gods' teachings, and between adventures you pay as much attention to the spiritual well-being of the common folk as you pay to your avenger prayers.

Many of the people you guard think you are nothing more than a rustic village priest or a wandering friar—unusually wise and compassionate, perhaps, but certainly no monster-slaying hero. They're mistaken, of course, but that suits you just fine. While you tend to their spiritual needs, you remain vigilant for trouble; brigands, marauders, hungry monsters, and villains all seek to prey on the weak and defenseless, so you stand guard over your flock to keep these threats at bay.

You prefer to avoid fame and glory, since that way leads to pride and an inevitable fall. To you it's far better to allow your fellow adventurers to bask in the triumphs of the day and downplay your own contributions. After all, you believe that your reward lies in the next world, not in this one.

You have chosen to follow a path of contemplation and calm. Some heroes are ruled by their passions, but you seek a disciplined approach to your quests. You are not emotionless, but you believe that you should rule your emotions instead of being ruled by them. Anger, despair, fear—all turn the mortal heart away from the divine will. Likewise, you must remain vigilant against excesses of mirth, desire, or pride. You believe that powerful emotions and worldly attachments entangle the spirit with the mortal realm and keep you from paying attention to what is most important.

Although you are slow to anger and careful in your actions, you are no pacifist. The world is full of dangers that must be met with force, and you are a warrior sworn to the service of the divine. When violent action is necessary—as it all too often is—you battle your enemies with dispassionate efficiency. You see no reason to waste words on those who can't or won't listen, or to extend mercy to those who would try to exploit it.
Between adventures, you strive to set an example of moderation and piety. Many serene initiates are cloistered monks who pass their days in monasteries, leading lives of self-discipline and prayer until they are needed to confront darkness again.

Many avengers find themselves confronting some great threat, such as a group of drow seeking to enslave a surface kingdom, an incursion of demons, a cult of Tharizdun worshipers, or an empire of vampires secretly ruling over human cities. Whatever the threat might be, it is dire enough to drive you to an old and powerful rite of sacred commitment. Through prayerful vigils, you have invested your oath of enmity with tremendous potency. All avengers rely on oath of enmity, but you draw on yours to perform exceptional feats in battle.

As a relentless slayer, you are always alert for signs that your enemies are at work. Your adventures often lead you away from a longtime adversary for weeks or months at a time, but you know that you have a sacred duty to which you must eventually return.

You have long harbored a divine spark within yourself, a subtle shard of your god's essence. Long has it lain dormant, but as you dispatch your enemies and see your oaths through, the essence awakens and infuses your body with astral brilliance until your mortal shell transmutes into something greater than what it once was. Your deeds are the catalyst for your transformation into a favored soul. Once you set foot on this glorious path, you ever after carry with you the blessings of your god.

Becoming a favored soul triggers several physical changes, specifically the appearance of feathery wings that grow, almost overnight, from your back. These wings have strength enough to bear your weight. Your feathers can be any color you like. As you continue down this path, your body lightens, your bones becoming hollow and strong so you can fly more easily without sacrificing your durability. By the time you complete this path, your lower body trails off into mist when you fly, thus marking you as one of the heavenly host, kin to angels, and a special servant of your god.

In the days of the human empire of Nerath, many temples and faiths were wealthy and widespread enough to give rise to powerful hierarchies, kingdom-spanning organizations that often wielded both religious and secular power. These empires of faith lapsed into disorder when Nerath fell. Temples lost touch with each other, local leaders split from their distant masters, and disaffected people abandoned the great temples for generations. But in a few places, the titles and trappings of the old hierarchies survive. Imperators are among these surviving traditions, a reminder of the days when archpriests maintained temple armies led by imperators, ruled over estates, and sponsored vigilant orders of inquisitors to ferret out dissent and disloyalty.

As a dread imperator, you have been invested in accordance with the old ways. Even though your deity's faith is only a shadow of its former kingdom-spanning glory, you still wield divine authority against your deity's enemies. You have the power to compel obedience from your foes and inspire loyalty in your allies. You are a guardian of what you consider the right path, tirelessly seeking out foes both hidden and open. The day will come when the faith is restored throughout the lands, and you mean to be there to see it.

You are among a small number of avengers who seek enlightenment through the study of desert dervish traditions. In the tireless turns of the dervish dance, the cares and distractions of the mortal world fall away, allowing you to perceive divine truths.

There are a number of dervish traditions, and not all dervishes are avengers; most are priests and scholars of desert peoples. Dervishes of the dawn represent a tradition celebrating the mystic power of the sunrise and venerating gods of hope and enlightenment. As a dervish of dawn, you are an agent of hope, a wandering mystic given the sacred task of fighting oppression and despair and setting an example of piety wherever you travel.

Most avengers undergo training in secret temples or monasteries to prepare for their service and receive their powers through rites of initiation, but some are endowed with divine power simply through raw devotion to their god. Such avengers dig deep within themselves to find unmatched reserves of faith, making up for their lack of formal training with holy passion. These are ardent champions.

As an ardent champion, you are an outsider, your spirit touched directly by the hand of your deity. You are most likely unlearned in the esoteric lore of your faith, and you have little connection to any hierarchies associated with it. In fact, others who lack your passion might see you as a threat to the established ways. Where cynics and pragmatists see despair or uncertainty, you see only your divine patron's will, and you set out to accomplish it regardless of obstacles. If you are meant to triumph, you will. If you are not, you are confident that you will soon be shown another way to serve your god.

Rangers in House Tharashk often become wayfinders, all-purpose guides who travel the world helping to resolve the house's quarrels. A wayfinder is part scout, part bounty hunter, and part inquisitive. As a wayfinder, you might, over the course of a season, guide dragon shard prospectors through dangerous wilderness, capture a fugitive, uncover who's smuggling poisons into the slums of Sharn, and even explore a dungeon or two along the way. Your dragonmark guides your attacks, whether you're fighting hand-to-hand or with a bow. Once you determine your quarry, you are relentless in your pursuit of it. Those who flee from you find that there's no escaping a wayfinder, only a delay of the inevitable.

Among the best duelists of House Orien are the swiftblades, peerless swordmasters whose Marks of Passage enable them to cut paths between worlds with their flashing blades. As a swiftblade, you can slice a rift in the fabric of the world, dart through it, and then appear on the other side of the battle field. When you practice against your peers, the fights range across neighborhoods and cities as you and your opponent teleport from place to place.
House Orien calls upon swiftblades to defend the house's interests with weapon and word. The house dispatches the duelists to conduct negotiations or investigate disturbances in its travel network. With their sophisticated demeanor, swiftblades are often underestimated by House Orien's enemies. Those who attract the ire of an Orien swiftblade quickly learn that the duelists are more than casual weaponmasters.

You are part of an unusual group of thieves. You are a member of House Kundarak's Ghorad'din, who are charged with testing the house's wards and recovering property stolen by those brazen enough to break into Kundarak vaults. You combine the magical prowess of a spellcaster with the stealth of a burglar. As a result, no barrier can stop you.
House Kundarak uses the Ghorad'din only rarely, and they answer only to Lord Morrikan, leader of House Kundarak. When a new high security vault needs testing, the house assembles a group of Ghorad'din to try to break in and expose weaknesses before any treasure is placed within. Although such practices hone your skills, you might prefer even greater challenges. The most skilled Ghorad'din are assigned to recover stolen property from other gifted thieves. Whispers also tell of Ghorad'din who operate as assassins.

When Sahemi the Emissary told House Jorasco that it should help heal Eberron from the wounds of the Last War, you listened. Despite resistance from much of the house, Sahemi insisted that the dragon mark that he and his kin bore mandated an effort to help heal the land. A supporter of Sahemi's efforts, you call yourself a jadehand for the jade bracelets you wear in emulation of the Emissary. You respect the druidic traditions, and you're interested in stopping supernal menaces and healing the world's scars, such as the Mournland. You have a broad view of what constitutes “healing,” so you also apply your skills liberally to help heal people and the land. For you, exposing a demonic cult and thwarting frontier banditry are just incisions and surgeries performed on a larger scale.

Deneith's protectors are among the most storied members of the house's Defenders Guild, an organization of mercenary bodyguards who are combat veterans. As a protector, you protect your charge with both combat prowess and the supernatural powers of your dragon mark. Although most of your comrades are probably members of the Defenders Guild, you might also find yourself working with the Blademarks Guild—an organization of mercenaries who provide a variety of services throughout Khorvaire—and the Sentinel Marshals, a group that ensures the enforcement of law and order. Your training has honed your skills to protect others, and you relish the opportunity to thwart enemies who try to attack your charges. Those foolish enough to venture such an assault swiftly meet your weapon as you deliver retribution for their audacity.

Warforged are an intriguing race, and regard for them ranges from viewing them as property to accepting them as people. Most folks resent, distrust, or tolerate warforged. You take a different view: You want to become one. During the Last War, a few mastermakers who worked in the foundries that produced warforged became convinced that warforged were exemplars of perfection. Now renegades from their former employers, these individuals seek to improve their own forms by installing mechanical augmentations into their flesh.
To become a self-forged, your first step is to install a battlefist, a mechanized steel appendage that resembles a gauntlet with articulated fingers. The battlefist replaces your hand, requiring you to sever your own appendage to make way for the new addition. As a result, only the most dedicated or mad artificers embark on this path.

Wandering crusaders who worship the Path of Light, lightwalkers travel between kalashtar communities, helping to resolve whatever conflicts or crises they face. As a lightwalker, one month you might be dealing with problems stirred up in Sharn by the Dreaming Dark, and the next month you might be off to protect kalashtar archeologists exploring ancient ziggurats in Q'barra. Many of your people are content to remain sedentary, living in isolated communities or within the temple-keeps of Adar. That life isn't for you, though. You are not satisfied unless you are actively battling against the darkness, helping to thwart the Dreaming Dark, attempting to destroy the Lords of Dust, or bringing peace to the civilizations of your people. As a lightwalker, you enjoy the light of purity and righteousness, but you recognize the need to oppose the tangible evils of the world.

Over sixteen thousand years ago, druids formed the Gatekeepers. They were charged with the dire responsibility of safeguarding the world from a burgeoning evil, the aberrant horrors dwelling within Khyber's depths. Although defeated once, these creatures still clamor for a chance to slip through reality's boundaries and conquer the mortal world. The Gatekeepers have failed only one time in their guardianship. Some nine thousand years ago, the daelkyr spilled from Xoriat, the Realm of Madness. Only a few Gatekeepers survived the struggle to bind the daelkyr behind great seals. From that moment, the Gatekeepers renewed their ancient oaths and have remained vigilant in their duties.
As a mystagogue of the Gatekeepers, you preserve the seals forged by your predecessors, and you work to contain the aberrant threat. Your mission carries you across the world, for the daelkyr and their spawn are unceasing in their efforts to thwart the seals. To oppose them, you have learned ancient techniques to steel your mind against their powers and to battle their fell influence.

The Last War saw incredible advances in artifice. With the creation of the warforged and the perfection of war machines, artificers attained a deeper understanding of how to blend technology with magic. Although most artificers train in the creation of magical servants, clockwork engineers elevate the practice to an art form.
As a clockwork engineer, you are a master of creating imitations of life from inanimate objects. You can piece together automatons in a few moments. The devices you create are more durable, longerlasting, and more deadly than those created by your artificer peers.
You fashion minions and artifices to aid your companions, although you probably feel as much kinship to the automatons as you feel toward your fellow adventurers. You might dote on your creations, lamenting when they become damaged, and even avenging their destruction.
Outside of combat, harmless clockwork creations surround you. They twitter and buzz, fluttering near you, keeping you company. Many are also helpers, and through their adroit appendages, you can construct other minions more quickly.

The Monastery of the Eternal Void stands at a crossroads where the Shadowfell washes against the world's shores. Some who study in the monastery delve into the Shadowfell's secrets, but most of the disciples there contemplate the nature of life and death, the soul's final migration, and the fate awaiting creatures in the afterlife. Proximity to the darkened plane informed the monastery's fighting techniques as they developed into their current forms.

Your training at the monastery opened your inner eye, allowing you glimpses from this world into the realm of the dead. Those visions left a mark on you; your flesh grew pale and dark circles ring your eyes, as if death's touch draws near. Despite these changes, you are no less vital and have gained uncanny insight into the nature of souls and their movements.

As a ghostwalker, you use psionic power to cloak yourself in shadow and thereby avoid enemy attacks. You can also strike at a foe's life force, sapping its strength. Mastery of these techniques allows you to seize your enemy's soul and ride it to another location.

You studied in a monastery devoted to the gods, guiding your mastery of psionic magic with the discipline and study of your faith. You likely worship Pelor or Bahamut, but most non-evil deities have at least one monastery dedicated to the fighting arts.

Your monk abilities are touched by divine power, allowing you to channel radiant energy and tap into the astral realm. Like other monks, you move with incredible speed and hit with unmatched power. In addition, the gods provide you with the ability to quash those who follow the gods of evil.

Dwarf monks are frequently drawn to this paragon path, since their piety and endurance allow them to withstand the mental and physical demands placed on a radiant fist.

You have earned the favor of the Winter Court and, perhaps, the Prince of Frost. The power of the Winter Fey flows through you, chilling your blood. At times, you can feel the presence of your bitter patron, watching the world through your eyes. This honor is dangerous. It means that your patron is well aware of your actions and the degree to which you are following the terms of your pact.
Other lords of the Feywild can sense your bond to the Winter Court. If you attend the Court of Stars or negotiate with the archfey, you might be treated with the respect owed to a faithful vassal, but this can be a double-edged sword. Compared to other mortals, you are expected to be aware of the customs of the court and to follow these rules. Failure to do so reflects poorly on you and your patron.
Your powers are tied to the primal force of winter. Your blood is cold in your veins, and you do not feel the bite of ice, snow, and bitter winds. Those who use cold against you will know what it's like to feel the touch of a frozen heart.

You have a diploma from one of the premier arcane academies, but that bit of paper was only a formality. What you took away from your years of education was an unshakable grounding in the arcane fundamentals and a justifiable confidence in your command over these forces. Since then, you've mastered the basics of magic and have begun to weave arcane energy like a true artist. You recognize other practitioners who have your level of education by their calm control over magic, as well as the depths of their knowledge and creativity.

Nothing is more precious to you than your familiar. The connection between you is deeper than that of a master and servant. Your accomplishments are the familiar's, too, and your thoughts are so often in synch that you practically share the same mind. Your familiar grows in power because of the strength of your bond, and arcane energy infuses its being more and more. As your reputation builds, your familiar is a part of your legend. When you begin to hear bard's tales about you, your familiar is mentioned (and sometimes receives top billing), and artistic representations of you show your companion, too.
Your path features all relate to your familiar, and your powers work only if your familiar is in active mode. Since it's important that your familiar stick around if you want to make full use of it, take some familiar feats (from Arcane Power) to increase its defenses and to gain other benefits.

Death and decay are as much part of nature as is birth and life. For the new to awaken in the world, the old must pass away. Although many druids champion life and a healthy wild, a few darkened souls embrace nature's darker side, immersing themselves in the grim necessity that plays just as an important part in the natural cycle as does birth. Like other druids, they fiercely protect the spirits and the wild from harm, but they use nature's darkest elements as weapons against their enemies.
In becoming a blightbeast, you identify with these sinister elements and come to embody death. The power you use might manifest in your humanoid appearance. Or you might hide your kinship to death until you assume your beast form, at which point your true nature is revealed.
You might be a coldhearted killer. Instead, you could use your newfound power to make room for new life. You can use your evocations to destroy those who threaten nature's splendor, or commit yourself to wiping out the enemies of the natural order. Your powers are as useful against unnatural and natural creatures alike.

By mastering your natural weapons and your other combat skills, you have transformed yourself into a living weapon. In searching yourself, you have melded opposing spiritual forces into a finely honed machine of war. The thrill of the fight flows through you, but you temper the impulse to give in to savagery.

To you, every contest challenges your resolve and focuses your mind toward absolute control over yourself and your situation.

The crowing moot of the shadar-kai is your playground, where your myth is in the making. Your accomplishments are known among your peers and written indelibly on your body. Words have you woven before your equals and lessers, telling the story of what you have done and where you have gone. Ever have you emerged undefeated. Doubt you've rebuffed with proof, perhaps even a gory show of strength. In the face of your enemies, you speak of their last moments and your inevitable victory. Maybe you even learn all you can about your greatest foes, telling them how the twisted path of history has led them into your reach and, ultimately, to doom. You have mastered the art of crowing to the level of the mystical. Oaths and boasts you make carry with them the fearsome shadow of fate. Adversaries quail before your bold speech, and your allies know what you say is a promise, not a hope. You're proof that bragging isn't really bragging if what you say is true.

Regardless of your religious bent, the traditions of your people run strong in your veins. Those veins have spilled your own dark blood for fated deeds; and those deeds have, in turn, moved you along the road to fulfilling the dream almost every shadar-kai holds in mind and heart. The natural course of your life seems to be to fulfill your people's ancient pact against all those who stand in opposition to departing creation. Whether through your intentional strengthening of your shadar-kai nature or by happy chance, your body has grown strong in death. You are drawn to those who defy death and fate, especially creatures that have immortality—natural or otherwise. To such ones you deliver the sweet freedom of death, sending them into the arms they sought to avoid. Their resistance is for naught. You are a representative of the inevitable. In your terrifying strength you abide—perhaps one day in immortality justly granted, but certainly in legend.

You appreciate the cosmos for what it is: a senseless place where mad gods play, primordials cavort, and wizards can make their mark. You understand that the world and its echo planes are not the result of deliberate design but of uncounted eons of slow iteration.
In a universe where gods control the fate of souls, weave the threads of destiny, and embody overarching principles, few find your philosophy reasonable. Some might even think you mad. But you have no illusions about ultimate meaning or purpose. If anything, your morality is purer: You perform acts of goodness not because you follow a code or seek some greater purpose, but because you choose to do so.

To see but go unseen, to affect the world but remain unaffected by it—this ability is at the heart of true magical power. Thus you have devoted yourself to the art of invisibility, rendering your body as transparent as a window without smear or blemish, through which no hint of your presence can be detected. You are an unseen mage; there is no stopping you. Or, more important, seeing you.
Since you can vanish with great alacrity and facility, you must learn to watch your step to avoid being trampled by your own allies. Even walking invisibly in the street requires constant vigilance, lest some carriage or palanquin unknowingly run you down. And with such great power comes the potential for abuse, against which you must be vigilant.

Summoned creatures can always be improved upon. Other arcane paths, such as the bonded summoner, deal with infusing magical energy into summoning spells to create a more perfect arcane cohort, but your way seeks the mastery of elemental cold. Using Primordial words of power, you have learned to enhance each summoned servitor with the essence of primordial ice.
This influx of wintery power is not confined to just those creatures you summon; it has also transformed your nature into something more elemental. You have adopted the innate abilities and resistance of primordial cold. Your skin, as well as the outward appearance of your summoned creatures, takes on an ice-blue pallor, and your hair becomes a shock of snow-white strands. Even your arcane flames burn with a rimefire blue color.

Few things please you more than creating nasty magical surprises for your foes. Although your traps are illusory, they are no less deadly to foes who stumble into them. As well, you love to add your own arcane flourishes to mundane traps, catching enemies off guard when they believed themselves safe. Admittedly, you might take unseemly glee in your phantasmal pyrotechnics. But wreaking havoc is so much fun!
Still, you must not incur your companions' wrath by scattering such deadly tricks too liberally, or putting them where they could be triggered by accident. So you are careful . . . as careful as a saboteur can be.

You are fascinated by the magic of summoning and conjuration. The power of the planes draws you almost as strongly as your own arcane strength pulls the creatures you call to your side. You form a stronger link than others with the creatures you summon, granting you increased control over them. This closer communication even allows you to manipulate the boundaries between planes. You are a beneficent master, though, and you imbue your summoned servants with greater vitality—in exchange for even more dedicated service.

Time and space are barriers to most creatures. Only gods, primordials, and legendary beings can break down those barriers. And—perhaps—people like you. You have already learned several powers that allow you to instantaneously travel between two nearby points. But now, as an arcane wayfarer, you see more clearly into the mechanism behind teleportation. As your knowledge grows, you teleport as
naturally and easily as you walk, moving from spot to spot by flexing your mind instead of your muscles. You don't restrict this knowledge to yourself; you also enjoy targeting others with spatial effects, sending friends to safety and transporting foes into dangerous locations.
Although time yet remains beyond your grasp, you know that space is not insurmountable, as most believe it to be. Indeed, sometimes the shortest distance between two locations is not a straight line.

In a small tome called Fey Pacts of Ancient Days, you discovered the names of ancient archfey once revered by primitive humans. The tome described Neifion the Lord of Bats, Zebechial the Lord of Lightning, and Morrisa the Lady of Swords.
You were amazed and intrigued. You could feel a power within each name calling out to you. These ancient entities, so long forgotten, offered you strength in exchange for devotion.
You eventually acquiesced, swearing yourself to the fey creature whose ethos you believed most matched your own: the Lord of Lightning. Now, the entity whispers secrets of the storm to you from his floating demesne within the Feywild. You listen carefully to each utterance, every growl of the storm or roar of lightning. Although the Lord of Lightning seems most concerned with unleashing the force of the storm, you have gained much power under his tutelage. It might be only a matter of time before your own spells rival the power of your master.

An oracle appeared to you in dream. She strode from a cave mouth, arrayed in the sea-green robes of an ancient prophet, and called herself the scion of the Sea Tyrant. “Behold!” she declared, revealing a vision of a terrible flood in which legions of angels were swept into eternal chaos. After showing you this disaster, the oracle bathed your eyes in water, and your vision was forever changed.
Like the prophets of old, you are capable of gaining horrible insights into the future. In most cases, your predictions extend so far ahead in time that you can do little to affect the course of events. However, you sometimes predict imminent events, and in these cases, you can take steps to avert or fulfill the occurrences you foresaw.

You understand the true nature of stars, and your knowledge surpasses that of nearly all other creatures. You have studied all the standard texts of star pact warlocks. You found the interpretations contained within those tomes to be catastrophic if accepted as fact. Perhaps some stars are windows into the Far Realm, as many star pact warlocks claim. You suspect that many stars hold other secrets, though. Thus, you have forged a new set of beliefs.
With your star charts, astrolabe, and viewing glass, you have determined the luminosity and motion of many stars. You have plumbed their colors, their sizes, and most important, the power they offer to a warlock. You understand the symbiosis of nature and magic that is embodied by the stars, and so you have twisted your pact into something different from those of your counterparts. You no longer fear the depths of the sky, for you are the master of the starry night.

Any warlock can scream “I curse you!” but in your opinion, such curses are shallow and meaningless. Such a simple, insubstantial curse is a betrayal of the warlock's ability to channel arcane might wrested from primeval entities. A normal curse might be enough to make an enemy quail, but you believe a curse should curdle the blood and elicit wide-eyed, slack-jawed shock.
You have delved deeply into the intricacies of crafting curses. You have discovered that greater effects can be wrung from a well-placed curse than most warlocks realize. When you place a hex, your foes reel from the power of your curse. You have learned to weave your spells with your curses and your curses with your spells. Your body and mind resonate with the damning curses you articulate. When you speak, all who hear your words flinch.

Your choice to swear a pact to an infernal entity in exchange for power was not an easy choice, but it was a choice you made with open eyes. You understand the moral dangers implicit in your pact, but you believe that your soul can withstand the physical and mental forces of Hell. Though devils constantly attempt to lure you into their sinister plots, you remain steadfast against their persuasion.
When an opportunity came to claim even more strength from your devilish patrons, you leaped at it. You accepted their empowering flames, wearing your might like a crown. Sometimes your allies worry about the ultimate fate of your soul, but you laugh off their concern. You assure them that you are in no danger, and that they need not pity you. However, you have heard the call of darkness, and sometimes you question what destination awaits you when you die.

Gods, primordials, and other powerful beings are sometimes preserved in the Astral Sea after their deaths. Drifting through the starry mists like immortal flotsam, they slumber through the millennia, awaiting the divine spark that might reawaken them. As the ages pass, the drifting corpses transform into astral matter.
Your curiosity was kindled when you first heard the term “dead god” while studying vestiges. Something about the concept of dead immortals fascinated you. And why not? When a god dies, where does its power go? You discovered the answer to this question: The power becomes dormant, crystallizing into a solid form within the Astral Sea. There, it drifts across the starry expanse, forgotten but not destroyed.
You study the history of deceased deities, primordials, and other legendary beings. From these accounts, you learn to siphon the beings' lost energy and dormant power. However, you know that real power lies in locating the crystallized essence of one of these dead immortals and awakening its full force.

You deter creatures with physical and psychological threats when they intend to harm you, your allies, or other things important to you. You believe that threats mean nothing, though, if you are not willing to deliver on them. When intimidation fails, you visit vengeance swiftly and fully upon the offending party.
In your mind, vengeance is a virtue. As a warlock of the dark pact, you viscerally understand the concept of vengeance. Many of the entities with which you make pacts are consumed by revenge. In the Underdark, slights and rivalries fester and give birth to bouts of ruthless skulduggery and sinister schemes.
As a dark reckoner, you have internalized your baleful emotions and feelings of injustice. From dark alleyways and unlighted tunnels, you draw inspiration and purpose. You understand that vengeance is a potent source of power.

In your earliest arcane training, you learned to sheathe yourself in a layer of magical protection. This protection is your Swordmage Warding, and it represents an extension of your arcane mastery. Unlike other swordmages, though, you have taken this talent to the next level.
You have long studied the secrets of the Swordmage Warding, and you have learned that the magical field is more flexible than most swordmages assume it to be. You have discovered that you can shape and sculpt your warding. Through careful study, you have learned to transform the warding into a protective barrier for your allies and into a dangerous weapon to distract or strike foes.

Although arcane finesse and delicate sword work are fine for others, you believe that better ways exist to subdue your enemies. You wonder why you should use subtlety when you can more quickly defeat your foe with a powerful sword strike combined with a blast of arcane energy.
As a sword of assault, you are interested in fusing magic with blade to create the most powerful attack you can. You have little tolerance for rigorous arcane training, preferring to use magic in a blast of raw elemental energy instead of a carefully crafted spell.
Similarly, you never saw the point of the refined swordplay of your counterparts, instead favoring strength over finesse. You believe that displaying your skill through elaborate parries and flourishes is an expression of a swordmaster's ego, rather than of skill. In your mind, such displays only slow battle. On the other hand, you make sure that all of your movements and arcane utterances contribute to the most devastating attack you can possibly deliver with a single swing of your blade.

Bereg-arnadh is the ancient eladrin art of drawing calligraphy with a blade. Bodyguards of the legendary eladrin queen Suiradrun were the first to use bereg-arnadh, and the practice has since become more widespread. Practitioners of this arcane tradition inscribe magical, glowing characters of Rellanic script into the air with their blades. These hovering runes are charged with arcane power from the calligrapher. The sigils hover for a short time, emitting a lambent radiance that evokes protection for allies or enmity toward foes.
Your mastery of the flying sword makes you an ideal practitioner of bereg-arnadh. Whether you studied texts to learn the art yourself, or you earned the right to study under a master of bereg-arnadh, you have gained the ability to wield the arcane art on the battlefield. On the tip of your blade, you sculpt runes, the mere sight of which strikes fear into your adversaries.

You can see the invisible bonds that connect creatures to the things around them. Your ability to recognize where these bonds are strongest and weakest gives you the power to strengthen or sever a bond when necessary. Your unique sight lets you see the paths that lie behind the world, and thus by cutting a creature's bond to the world, you can send a foe or an ally hurtling along a hidden path.
You are a master of gaining tactically advantageous positions in combat. You look for a central position on the battlefield from which you can utilize all your powers and abilities to send creatures careening through extradimensional space. You are concerned with terrains and obstacles only insofar as you can use them to your advantage.
Using your aegis of ensnarement, you thwart your foes' movements and leave them reeling. You can unleash a vicious jolt of magical feedback that shocks your foes. As a sage of fate's bonds, you want powers that allow you to mark as many foes as possible with your aegis of ensnarement, thereby giving you control of the battlefield and the power to dole out numerous jolts of lightning.

Like many swordmages, you can effortlessly travel the roads behind the world. Those arcane pathways offer you more than they do your fellows, though, for you have actually learned to slip through the space between planes.
Your travels through the weave of reality have transformed your knowledge and skills. As you bend space with cunning strokes of your sword, you can be in two places at once, splitting your physical body between the dimensions. You might briefly take on the seeming of a ghostly spirit, but this appearance is only a temporary transformation. Even when you step between worlds, your blade doesn't fade—remaining a very real threat to your enemies.
Your eerie form has gained you the moniker of “ghost” in some circles. You smile to hear such nicknames, although they are untrue, because you knowthat fear is a valuable weapon.

You are adroit at spotting chinks in your enemies' defenses and taking advantage of those weaknesses to inflict debilitating blows. Your arcane senses give you the upper hand when you face creatures that rely on natural resistances.
As an arcane hunter, you might have been trained at an early age to visually recognize the physical weaknesses of creatures. Since then, your magical education has further refined those skills, allowing you to extend tendrils of unseen energy to feel out a foe's flaws.
In your studies and adventures, you have learned that adaptability is one of the best qualities when facing a variety of foes. Instead of specializing in one damage type or one type of attack, you prefer to have options.

In the frozen wastes, and in the frost-blasted fields of winter, you feel at home. You find the cold, harsh conditions hospitable, even comforting. You can pull winter storms from across the world, or even from the Elemental Chaos, and use them to ruin your enemies. When you attack, your body is covered with ice crystals, and your skin pales. Your spells fill the air around you with blowing snow or hail, and powerful winds whip up.
The blizzard is your best friend and your most ferocious servitor. With its aid, you move creatures about inside killing blasts and knock them down with freezing vortexes of driving snow and ice.
Is it any wonder that your heart has grown cold, too? It is up to you whether your nature grows more and more aloof like the bleak season you embody, or whether your heart yet shelters a warm hearth for those you name friend.

Far to the north in the Feywild echo of the world, a freezing wind howls out of the Scourge Mountains every twenty years. Colloquially called the scourge wind, this is no common gale; it is the manifestation of an ancient curse, created when an infant eladrin princess of elder blood was slain in her crib. That evil deed resonates yet, despite efforts by later sovereigns to make amends, building year after year until a sentient, malevolent storm is born. Infused with rage for innocence lost, the lethal blast is bent on freezing to death as many creatures as possible before it blows itself out.
In answer to this recurring threat, the eladrin of the foothills found a way to keep the scourge wind at bay—a song of life that diminishes the hatred and fury of the storm and ameliorates its lethal cold. As a life singer, you have studied this song and honed your voice to pacify the scourge wind. Your sacred quest is to travel the worlds, promoting peace and protecting life, so that you can infuse your song with the experience you gain. When the scourge wind next blows, you and the chorus of other life singers will be ready to lift your voices in the great song of life.

Moral consequence is something all creatures face, whether they recognize its existence or not. The effects of each creature's deeds influence the past, present, and future. You do not hold this view as a philosophical belief: It is demonstrably true.
Each action a being takes is like planting a seed. Depending on the deed's nature, harvesting its fruits might bring joy or pain. You seek to increase your own measure of joy in the world, while ensuring that your foes reap equivalent pain for their past misdeeds.
You are an interpreter of karma. With your prescient sight, you can collect your foes' karmic debt in a timely, sometimes dramatic fashion. On the other hand, your own actions touch only lightly on the karmic surface of cause and consequence. You shape the fates of others without unduly affecting your own final destiny.

You hate to be tied to any one location for too long; you'd rather be on the road, meeting new creatures and seeing new lands and nations. As a result, you feel at home nearly anywhere. This same ability also puts you in the good graces of people you meet along the way.
Your inborn empathy and acquired diplomatic skill allow you to fit into nearly any society—if not as someone who has always lived there, then at least as a trusted friend. By understanding many kinds of people and creatures, you learn how to protect them—or fight them, if need be.
When things turn rough, you can use your knowledge of other creatures to your advantage in a fight. The more foes that try to stop you, the better you can tangle their swords and spells, confounding their attempts to hurt you.

Rumors of an ancient organization of assassin-bards sometimes surface in taverns. Such tales are quickly quelled as foolish romance, of course. If the existence of the secret group to which you belong became common knowledge, your work would be that much harder to accomplish.
Your shadowy organization, known as the Grave Callers, has tasked its members to seek out and slay those who prey on the innocent. Its leaders identify those individuals to you through clever courier drops or magical sendings, marking them indelibly as your targets. You are making the world a better place with each undesirable element that you remove, and that knowledge drives you to continue your work. Through your ancient and deadly song, you improve the chances of all other creatures, one death at a time.

You intertwine music, archery, and magic into a single glorious craft that is as artistic as it is martial. Your foes waver between fear and admiration even as you draw a bead on them. Every shot from your bowstring resonates with a melodious tone, and the percussion of your arrows finding their marks drives the battle forward like a drumbeat. Even your foes' cries of pain blend with the clash of weapons against shields and armor. Your arcane might weaves it all into a fantastic symphony of battle.
Creating this wondrous performance depends partially on your ability to see an instant into the future. Timing is everything.

Fey tricksters, gnomes, and storytellers of every race know many legends unfamiliar to other creatures—tales from secluded forests, burrows deep underground, the lairs of powerful beasts, and the locked vaults of powerful monarchs. And what they don't know, they make up.
As a cunning prevaricator, you traffic in the honored (at least among some) traditions of exaggeration, misdirection, and out-and-out lying. You study and follow the teachings of great fabulists of the past—all of them fictional, almost certainly—and apply that knowledge to your bardic skills. You transfer your natural talent for illusion and deception to your friends, granting them some small measure of glory—or so you try to convince them.

Like the trees of the forest, you draw strength from the loamy earth, from the water that spills from the sky and flows across the land, and from the radiance of the sun. You embrace the essence of the tree, becoming the forest's protector, its champion against those that would despoil it. When you use your primal powers, shoots of new growth emerge from the ground, flowers bloom, and trees straighten with renewed vigor.
You favor guardian form powers that let you take on treelike forms (such as form of the willow sentinel, form of the oak sentinel, and form of the rowan sentinel), but even when you take on other aspects, the earth responds with growth. As the culmination of this path, you can take on a form like that of a treant, smashing foes and objects alike with a weapon held in your branchlike fists.

To many, there is no clearer expression of the power of nature than the raging fury of the storm. Churning clouds, crashing thunder, and blasting lightning are manifestations of the rage coursing through the world when its natural laws are violated and its purity corrupted. When gods or primordials overstep their bounds, when demons or aberrant beings try to tear the fabric of reality, the fury of a storm—and its cleansing rain—are part of nature's response.
Most wardens draw power from the earth. As an incarnation of the storm's wrath, your greatest primal power comes from the sky. Lightning flows in your veins, and thunder booms in your footsteps. As you advance along this path, you can transform yourself into wind and rain and can ultimately take on the aspect of storm's wrath.

The primal power you wield has formed a bond between you and the natural creatures of the world. In their myriad forms, you see fractured reflections of a greater being: the Primal Beast, who was the world's first predator. All the hunting animals of the world—mighty lions and howling wolves, lowly ferrets and soaring eagles—hold a distant echo of the Primal Beast in their hearts.
In your commitment to protect the world from demons, aberrations, and other beings that would corrupt the balance of nature, you find yourself growing closer to the Primal Beast's perfection. That growth is reflected in your bloodwrath—the heightened speed you gain when you adopt a guardian form, and the fury that punishes the enemies you mark. At the pinnacle of your path, you at last gain the ability to take on the form of the Primal Beast.

In the early years of the world, the mightiest sorcerers were dragons, powerful spellcasters who used the elemental magic churning in their blood to create devastating spells that cemented their hold over vast empires. Even as recently as the dragonborn empire of Arkhosia, dragons were the exemplars of the draconic sorcerer's path. In the present age, however, few dragons practice the art that their ancestors created.
Your path follows in the ancient footsteps of the greatest sorcerers the world has ever known, drawing on the traditions preserved from Arkhosia's dragon lords and the sorcerers before them, back almost to the beginning of the world. Wielding the same power as the dragons of old, you inure yourself to the dangers of battle, making your mere presence a threat to your foes as you wreathe yourself in flames or lightning, acid or poison, cold or thunder, according to the nature of the draconic magic in your blood.
The dragons of old are alive in your soul, and their power is yours to command.

Arcane magic is a form of power wielded for purposes both benevolent and malevolent. There is nothing inherently good or evil about it. Its moral value depends on the purpose to which it is put. At least, that is usually the case.
As a demonskin adept, you wield arcane power ripped from the depths of the Abyss, the home of demons. You incorporate the ritually treated skins of demons into your clothes and armor, and you use those skins to open conduits through which your spells are warped by the Abyss's unutterable evil. Perhaps you believe that good ends justify evil means, but how long can you maintain your desire for good when you allow such evil to touch your soul? The power you wield is stolen, and the lords of the
Abyss do not take kindly to being robbed. Although this path brings great power, it is power that comes at a sometimes terrible price. Count yourself lucky if the worst price you pay is your life.

Arcane power flows in all sorcerers, an innate part of them. For you, however, that power is like a geyser building up beneath the earth before it finally erupts with devastating and glorious force. Your connection to that power has always been easy, almost instinctual. It's so much a part of you that it slowly transforms you, making you into a being as much of the forces you channel as of flesh and soul.
As you walk the path of the arcane wellspring, you master a second damage type. You learn spells that channel both damage types or that surround you with swirling arcane energy. Ultimately, you gain the ability to transform yourself into arcane energy for a brief time.

What is a spirit but an exhalation of the world, a distillation of life lived in the drawing and releasing of breath? The spirits of the world are alive, and that means they are in motion. They are a wind that blows through the world, even in the solid rock of the earth's deepest reaches.
As a spirit tempest, you tap into the movement of the spirit world, the wind that blows through all things. You draw on that movement to bring motion to the field of battle: You call spirit winds to transport yourself and your allies in the blink of an eye, to carry your healing power and the power of your attacks into larger areas, and to empower the attacks of your allies.
The spirits are the breath of the world. Breathe deeply, and let them move and guide you.

Many shaman traditions revere the Great Bear as the perfect example of the protector spirit. As a mother bear furiously guards her cubs against danger, so the Great Bear stands guard over the world, protecting it from those who would destroy or corrupt it, and so too do you, as a Great Bear shaman, protect your adventuring companions. Your spirit companion is your link to the Great Bear, channeling its strength and endurance to you through your evocations.
Your main purpose is to stand alongside other warriors and make them stronger. When you can, protect the weak. When you cannot, strengthen the strong to make them better protectors. As you pursue the path of the Great Bear shaman, your spirit companion channels the power of the Great Bear to harry your enemies, punishing them when they attack your friends. Your companion roars with the ferocious strength of the Great Bear, galvanizing your allies into action. You give your allies additional attacks whenever you spur yourself to greater action, and you empower the attacks they make when enemies drop their guard.
You are the world's protector, and the Great Bear's roar echoes in every word you speak.

The mystery of the primal stalker is that death is a constant presence in the midst of life; the death of the prey brings life to the predator. And when death comes to the predator, it brings life to scavengers and carrion feeders. Death is part of the great wheel of mortal existence, and an important part of the shaman's communion with the spirit world.
As a shaman, you have always walked close to death. Now you have set out on the path of the ghost panther, where life and death twine together still closer. You stalk the wild, hiding from your prey, leaping and climbing like the most agile of cats. You call on panther spirits to attack your foes, weaken your prey, help you leap away from enemy attacks, and lead you through the spirit world to teleport adjacent to your foes.

The World Serpent, legend says, is among the greatest of the primal spirits that established the natural laws of the world and is one of the staunchest defenders of those laws. When a divine exarch and the servant of a primordial joined forces in an attempt to tamper with the natural order, the World Serpent simultaneously crushed the life from them both. The earth is said to rest in this mighty serpent's coils, the motion of which shakes the ground.
As a disciple of the World Serpent, you are charged with maintaining the balance of the natural order and ensuring that creatures from beyond the mortal realm keep to their place. You wield the World Serpent's power, using it to pierce your foes with its fangs or crush them in its coils. Your spirit companion hinders the movement of your enemies as the World Serpent's coils echo through the space around it.

During the war against the primordials, Moradin and Kord worked together to forge Guldarak, “the God Hammer.” They crafted the hammer out of raw thunder and bound its handle with rings of lightning. Moradin was the first to wield the hammer, taking it into the Great Dismal Delve in the heart of the Elemental Chaos. Moradin used the God Hammer to shatter the stone that protected the primordial Zurtharak, who was called the Vein of Iron for the way he burrowed and twisted through solid stone. With Kord and Bahamut at his side, Moradin then used the hammer to shatter the primordial's body.
Several other gods wielded Guldarak during the war, and the hammer became a symbol of divine vengeance. Each time the primordials scored a victory against the gods, a god lay a hand on Guldarak, swore an oath of vengeance, and then took up the hammer and carried out that oath.
Like Guldarak, you are an instrument of divine vengeance, wielding thunder to smite your god's foes. Thunder wards your allies and dazes your enemies, and can even teleport your allies to your side.

When the gods warred with the primordials at the dawn of time, the gods fought to bring hope to the world they had helped to create. If the world had been left to the primordials, it would have been a fearsome place, dominated by tyrants who might destroy and remake any part of the world without warning. All the mortal inhabitants of the world might have been slaves, as the dwarves were enslaved by the titan servitors of the primordials. At best, they might have been terrified fugitives, hiding in despair from the wanton destruction of the world's elemental rulers.
Because the gods fought the primordials and freed the world from their dominion, the mortal races can live in hope. It is your sacred trust to nurture the embers of hope in the world and stir them into great bonfires that shed light into the world's darkest places. As a flame of hope, you wield powers of fiery radiance that heal and inspire your allies while burning and blinding your foes.

Divine wrath can manifest as punishing blasts of radiant light, as fire from the heavens, or as thunder and lightning that smite the gods' foes. Sometimes, though, the gods' anger is manifested in plagues and curses upon the wicked. Even good deities can resort to extreme methods to purge the world of corruption.
As a blightspeaker, you wield such extreme methods in your god's name. Like an angel of death, you wield the scythe of necrotic power and harvest life from your enemies to fuel your own strength. To the common folk, you are a frightful presence, a grim reminder of your god's darker side. To your enemies, you are a terror, a manifestation of the judgment that has been pronounced upon them and of the punishment that awaits.

During the gods' ancient war against the primordials, invokers were their most trusted mortal servants, allowed to wield the raw divine power typically reserved for the gods' immortal agents, the angels. Over time, the distinction between the most favored mortal invokers and the angels themselves became hard to define. Some invokers drew so much divine energy into themselves that they took on angelic aspects. Some angels, conversely, emptied themselves of divine essence and clothed themselves in mortal flesh as invokers, voluntarily limiting their own power in order to serve as more effective divine agents in the world.
One of those paths is yours, and it has led you to this point: You are neither fully mortal nor fully angel, but some of both. As an angelic aspect, you can channel divine energy through your mortal body to take on angelic characteristics: resistance to the forces of dark and light, an awesome presence that strikes fear into the hearts of those who try to strike you, wings to fly across the field of battle, and mighty attacks akin to those of angels.
If you were born mortal, your transformation is beginning; you are on the threshold of becoming something more, and immortality awaits. If you have always been an angelic being veiled in flesh, the veil is beginning to part and your true nature is being revealed. Either way, your enemies have much to fear.

Although the Primal Beast usually appears as a mammalian predator, some aspects of the Primal Beast soar through the sky on feathered wings, hunting prey from the air. Eagles, hawks, and falcons are no less fierce predators than panthers and wolves, and some druids assume their forms to fly after their own prey.
	You are such a druid, a sky hunter who emulates birds of prey in your beast form. Your beast form can't always fly, but it can take to the air from time to time. Some sky hunters assume a beast form a little like a cockatrice—a stalking predator with primitive wings that allow it to fly in short bursts. Others retain their normal beast form but change momentarily into a bird form when they use their sky hunter powers.

According to druidic legend, the Hidden Flame is a spark of vigor and vitality that exists within every creature. Beasts, especially predatory mammals, are said to live in harmony with the Hidden Flame within them, calling upon it to fuel their hunting fury. When a creature lets the Hidden Flame burn out of control, the result is a mad savagery that is no more in harmony with the natural way of things than the behavior of those civilized folk who act as if no flame burns within them at all.
You are a keeper of the Hidden Flame, able to tap into this wellspring of strength and bestial fury. By calling to the Hidden Flame in a creature, you can spur that creature into a frenzy that leaves no room for strategic or tactical thinking. You draw on the Hidden Flame in yourself and your allies to perfect your predatory instinct, helping you fight with terrible ferocity.

Ancient compacts and edicts protect the natural world from too much interference by gods and primordials. As much as primordials, as well as demons, might like to tear the world apart and draw it back into the Elemental Chaos from which it was made, their power is limited. To many druids' eyes, the greatest threat that now faces the world is not god or primordial, but alien creatures from the Far Realm that are not bound by the ancient laws. These creatures don't necessarily want to destroy the world, but whether or not they mean to, they corrupt it simply by being in it.
As a guardian of the Living Gate, you have sworn to seek out and kill aberrant creatures that have ties to the Far Realm and to seal any portals between that plane and the world. You might have joined an order of like-minded druids (the organization known as the Circle of the True is the largest such order), or you might have found your own way into the esoteric knowledge of the Living Gate. The mystical powers you learn on this path, starting with the first ward of the Living Gate, are generally useful for protecting your allies and bringing ruin to your enemies, but your charge is to use them to defend the natural world from forces that would corrupt and destroy it.

Several legends tell of the blood moon, a night or sometimes a season when the Primal Beast stalks the wilderness of the world in physical form. During the blood moon, the predators of the world are said to be more dangerous and to have an insatiable hunger. According to some legends, the blood moon is a perversion of the world's natural state, brought about by the gods or by the fierce response of the primal spirits to some violation of their precepts. Whatever the cause and exact effects of the blood moon, some druids use these legends as a symbol for their own ferocious zeal in protecting the natural balance of the world.
You are a blood moon stalker, favoring your beast form and choosing powers that make you more dangerous in that form. As your body transforms into beast form, so too your mind embraces your bestial side. You take pride and pleasure in fighting without conscious thought, drawing on bestial instinct and wisdom to guide your attacks upon your prey. You are a fierce hunter, a silent stalker of the wilds, but you are also a crusader for the primal spirits, ensuring that neither gods nor primordials overstep the bounds set for them at the dawn of time.
Through the power of the blood moon, you and your spirit brothers, sisters, and ancestors are the custodians of the world.

Bards look to the tales of past heroes for inspiration and use those tales to spur their allies. As a war chanter, you embrace those tales as a pattern for your own life, leading your companions into battle with songs and cadences that extol the virtues of bravery, endurance, and strength of arms. The roar of battle, the clash of steel on steel, the warrior's cry, the tramp of marching feet—these are all notes you weave into the symphony of war, which flows across the field like a raging torrent, catching up your friends and foes alike.
Your music and oratory inspire your allies to greater deeds of valor. Your Virtue of Valor grants temporary hit points to you as well as to your allies, and your own battle prowess can bolster your allies against injury. Your powers are similar in some ways to those of a warlord, granting your allies movement and attacks against the foes you strike with your own weapon.

Your voice is your power, and as you study and practice ancient bardic traditions, your power grows stronger. The rumble of thunder in a stormy sky, the tremor of the earth that topples buildings, the rhythm of waves crashing against the shore, the explosive detonation of fire—your voice is the raw elemental power of sound, booming and concussive.
Variations of this path appear in the bardic traditions of many races and cultures. Eladrin often associate their magical traditions with forces of nature, and like a bralani of autumn winds or a tulani of summer sun, you might be a noble eladrin of the thunderstorm. Dwarf and goliath bards are more inclined to think of the rumble of stone. Drow bards speak of the voice of fury or of madness that empowers their harshly beautiful music. Tieflings wield explosive force with their mighty voices.
The features and powers of this path increase the range and effectiveness of your thunder powers. Your thunderous songs and shouts echo to repeat their assault on your foes, and your song of thunder gives your allies the ability to conjure echoes of your booming voice.

Among the most powerful residents of the Feywild is Tiandra, the Summer Queen (see Manual of the Planes). Her court is a reflection of her unearthly beauty, hung with flower garlands and alive with bustling activity. Her smile can ripen crops, and her favor bestowed on a mortal can quicken the gifts of song and poetry.
Whether the Summer Queen has actually smiled on you or you merely aspire to seek her blessing, you claim some association with the Summer Fey and study their musical magic. In your feytouched presence, you and your allies teleport freely, and you can call on the Summer Queen's powers of growth to aid your own healing powers.
If you serve the Summer Queen well, you might hope to receive some favor from her. Great heroes of the past have sometimes received noble titles, magic instruments, access to powerful enchantments, and other gifts from her hand. As the fey go, the Summer Queen is relatively trustworthy, but be warned: No fey gift is truly free.

Among the many legends told by bards, a few mythic figures appear with some regularity, including the mysterious Seven. The Seven are sisters, or sometimes brothers, whose names vary from tale to tale. They're not gods, but they're not mortals either; sometimes they're exarchs of Corellon or some other god, and sometimes they're angels who come from seven different dominions. But most often, they're simply the Seven. Some tales describe them as patrons of the arts, inventors or sponsors of dance, poetry, singing, instrumental music, painting, drama, and the like. Other tales describe them as patrons of every mortal activity, or even as sponsors of different power sources. The Seven are never exactly the same in any two tales, or even in the same tale told twice. And as their student, neither are you.
Following the promptings of the Seven, your interests accept no limitations. No narrow field of study can contain your wide-ranging curiosity. You excel as an arcane leader, but what's to prevent you from learning a few tricks from a martial defender or a primal controller? No knowledge is off limits, and nothing is impossible.
By taking multiclass feats and learning powers from a variety of classes, you always have the right tool for the job. In addition, you learn spells that have enormous versatility, ensuring that you can provide help anytime you or an ally needs a bonus in a specific area. You dabble in a little bit of everything, and you manage not only to improve yourself but also to make others a little better at what they do best.

The wilderness is your home, and your connection to the primal spirits of the land grants you speed and ferocity. You move through the forest like a deer, and you charge into battle with the cheetah's speed and fury.
The powers of a wildrunner emphasize mobility, letting you shift and move quickly while striking your foes. You pounce from foe to foe, avoiding opportunity attacks while dealing all the damage your rage can muster.
Elf barbarians are frequently drawn to this paragon path, because its powers complement their natural mobility. Likewise, many rangers who nurture a connection to the primal forces of nature by taking barbarian multiclass feats find this path appealing.

Many barbarians combine mastery of primal power with an imposing personal presence and natural leadership ability. The most dreaded warriors among them are fearbringer thanes, who harness those twin powers to strike terror into their enemies' hearts.
As a fearbringer thane, you shape battles with your will and your fearsome presence. Fear is a weapon you wield, turning your foes to quaking weaklings before you cut them down with your axe or sword. As your rages seize you and fill you with primal power, that power flows out from you to inspire your allies and fill your enemies with terror.
Many fearbringer thanes use their power to gather hordes of savage warriors under their banners. Others, including most player characters, lead smaller bands of adventurers on raids into dungeons and other adventure sites. In either case, a fearbringer thane is something like a hybrid of barbarian and warlord, as close to a leader as a barbarian comes.

You revere the bear as a symbol of the warrior's strength and prowess. Through long and ancient rites, you have bound that symbol to your heart with more than just words and totems. In battle, you become the bear, shaping your form to its form and your strength to its strength.
Most bear warriors strive to emulate the bear beyond combat situations. You might catch fish with your bare hands, tear open beehives to feast on the honey inside, or roar in an aggressive territorial display. Like many barbarians, you're more at home in the wild places of the world than when surrounded by buildings.

Every avenger is trained in the ruthless art of combat and skilled in the art of isolating a foe and dispatching it with a few swift blows. Some avenger sects also emphasize the art of stealth—particularly those dedicated to deities who favor stealth, shadows, and secrecy, including Sehanine, Lolth, Zehir, and Vecna. Among these avengers, the most dangerous follow the path of the zealous assassin.
As a follower of this path, you embody devotion and ruthlessness in equal measure, making you a deadly weapon aimed at your deity's foes. Your skills are focused on the ability to slip in and out of shadows at the edge of combat, dealing blows that quickly dispose of enemies. You pool shadows around yourself or hide in a nimbus of divine light, and you master techniques that take advantage of openings in combat, dealing greater damage when you have combat advantage or against bloodied foes. At the culmination of the path, you can make yourself invisible to your foe, then sear it with blinding radiance that leaves it more susceptible to your attacks.

At the culmination of your rite of initiation years ago, one of the avengers in your secret temple pulled back the hood of a voluminous cloak to reveal a face that was not mortal, but fully divine. You saw the face of your god in that moment, and that sight transformed you. That knowledge of divine presence is what allows you to wield the power you have and what authorizes you to act in your god's name. Slowly—ever so slowly—you are growing into the image of your god, to the point where your face begins to reveal your deity's countenance as well.
To the initiated in your faith, the face of your god is a wondrous sight, capable of inspiring awe and increased devotion. To the enemies of your god, the face is a thing of fear, of searing and blinding radiance.
Your path is about your own physical and spiritual transformation. As you progress along the path of the unveiled visage, you become a more clear mirror of your god's face and a more faithful expression of the god's will. You can tap into the vigilance of the divine mind and transform yourself into a divine aspect not unlike an angel, flying on wings to better fight your god's foes.

For certain avenger sects, the swearing of oaths is a central part of their religious observances and their rites of initiation. In the teachings of these sects, an oath sworn by an avenger is akin to the words of creation spoken by the gods to give lasting form to the world; when the avenger's will and the god's will are one, an avenger's oath has the power to make reality conform to the words of the oath.
As a member of one of these oathsworn sects, your oath of enmity power carries particular weight. When you swear your god's judgment against a foe, that creature's attacks are less likely to harm you. When your foe lies dead, you claim the reward of fulfilling your oath, drawing new vigor for the remaining battle. As you advance along the oathsworn path, you gain powers that are more effective against the target of your oath, weakening it or making it vulnerable to your later attacks. You can even grant the benefit of your oath of enmity to your allies for a short time, ensuring that they help you bring your foe to justice.

As the blacksmith's hammer shapes metal according to the smith's will, so you have been sent to shape the world to your god's will. A tool and a weapon in your god's hand, you are called to shape the course of kingdoms and punish those who stand opposed to the ways of your god. Although the smith's hammer is a tool of building and creation, in time of need it can also be a weapon of destruction.
In following this path, you emphasize the control elements of many avenger powers, particularly pulling, pushing, sliding, and teleporting your foes. You gain abilities that let you push your foes even with powers that don't normally involve forced movement and that increase the distance you move your foes with your powers. Your new attack powers push your targets around or knock them to the ground.
True to the name of this path, you are most effective if you are wielding a hammer, such as a maul.

Among the elves, a rare few embrace the splendor of the natural world and draw power from its bountiful life in ways that others cannot begin to understand. Such elves champion nature in all its forms, placing the needs of the wilderness above their own. These heroes are called twilight guardians, for they preserve the wilderness from the encroaching darkness, safeguarding the natural world from destruction at the hands of the incautious and the malevolent alike.
Though it might seem that the twilight guardian chooses to champion the cause of nature, most twilight guardians would say that the world chose them. The world responds, they believe, to an uncommon reverence for nature, an awareness of the true power of life, and an understanding of the need for a harmonious balance to ensure the world's survival. These qualities arise most commonly among the elves, and thus the path of the twilight guardian is unique to that race.
As a twilight guardian, you evolve into a physical conduit of natural power, channeling the life force of the earth itself to better combat your enemies. The power flowing though you sharpens your senses and attunes you to your surroundings. Protecting the wilderness is your paramount concern. You are not required to safeguard a particular region, but instead to protect nature wherever you go in your travels. As long as you remain a stalwart protector, the natural world will aid you in your crusade, lending you its strength to ensure your triumph over those who would contaminate the land.

The sins of Bael Turath lie exposed in the sinister appearance of its tiefling descendants. Each pair of horns, every sinewy tail, and every set of glowing red eyes reminds the world of the perils of dealing with devils and the evils that result from such fell bargains. Many tieflings rise above the darkness clouding their souls, but a few find it far harder to divorce themselves from their sinister heritage, largely because of their familial connections to those first tieflings who forged pacts with Asmodeus and other archdevils of the Nine Hells.
As a Turathi highborn, you bear a heavier burden than your kin, for it was your ancestors who damned the tiefling race. For better or worse, you retain a stronger connection to the Nine Hells than most of your race. You loose bursts of hellfire on your enemies when enraged, and infernal power undergirds your other talents. Drawing on the lore of Bael Turath's ancient nobility, you can unhinge the minds of your foes or make them your slaves—even as you engulf them in hellfire.

There can be no understating the kinship that goliaths share with their mountain homes. Like the mountains, goliaths stand tall despite the hardship of life amid the wind, snow, and ice of the highest crags. Most goliaths are proud merely to draw strength from their upbringing amid the towering peaks, but a rare few come to embody the spirit of the mountains.
You are such a hero, a stoneblessed goliath who has an uncommon connection to stone and earth. Rock beneath your feet emboldens you, and the elements nourish you, until you become the personification of your homeland's peaks. As a stoneblessed, you draw power from the stone itself, allowing you to transcend the bounds of your mortal form and achieve astonishing acts of strength. Your attacks strike with the weight of the mountain behind them. When you reach the pinnacle of this path, you can transform yourself into an entity of stone, crushing those who stand against you.
When you take the first step on this path, your features and form begin a slow transformation, revealing the depth of your mountain connection. Your skin gains the texture of sandstone, thickening to protect you from harm. Your eyes lose their moisture until they eventually shine like diamonds, reflecting light in a rainbow. The lithoderms that stud your shoulders and elbows transform into crystalline growths. Among goliaths, these features mark you as a true champion, a chosen hero of your kind.

A few eladrin heroes, however, champion the cause of their race as a whole, rather than of any particular house. Though they are often anointed by house nobles, these shiere knights are free agents, beholden to no particular house and dedicated to protecting the eladrin from fomorians, spriggans, and other hostile denizens of the Feywild.
Becoming a shiere knight involves more than attaining a title. As a champion of your race, you become a living embodiment of the power of the Feywild. Your appearance is marked by a sign of the fey power within you: a faint glow that outlines your frame and burns in your eyes, an eldritch wind that constantly stirs the air around you, or some other manifestation of your otherworldly nature. You can channel this power to beguile your foes or drive them off in fear.

Scions of Arkhosia are the descendants of the noble dragonborn heroes of the fallen empire of Arkhosia. In the years since that empire fell, its heirs have scattered across the world, their lineage and heritage confused or lost in the darkness of the present age. Most dragonborn spend their lives unaware of what sort of potential lies within them, but a few manage to awaken and master their hidden reserves of power.
You are one of these scions, and you have begun the long and arduous process of unlocking the power of your noble blood. Your ancestry places you closer to your dragon kin than other dragonborn are. As a result, you gain a greater mastery over your dragon breath, able to alter its substance at will.
The clearest sign of your noble heritage, though, is the draconic wings that begin to form on your back as soon as you adopt this paragon path. They take some time to grow strong and large enough to sustain short bursts of flight, but they mark you unmistakably as what you are: a hero of your people reborn.

Shifters harbor a bestial nature inside themselves. When a shifter is under duress, this nature reveals itself in his or her features and prowess. This innate savagery is the gift of shifters' lycanthrope ancestors, the quality passed down through the generations that gives the shifter race its identity. Most shifters can call on their legacy when needed, but you enjoy a closer kinship to your lycanthrope forebears.
You take the name moonstalker for the strong lycanthropic heritage you have awakened in your spirit. You have always had an animalistic side, manifested in your physical features and sometimes through your behavior, but at some point you learned that you were different, and that the gift from your ancestors was greater than you could have believed. You are still able to shift your form, physically expressing shifter traits, but you can take that power a step farther and use your bestial nature to fully transform into a wolf or a tiger. This ability accompanies a host of other changes, and your tactics and behavior leave behind civilized methods for those of an untamed predator.

The greatest heroes of halfling legend are those who defeat giants, dragons, or other oversized threats to their homes and communities, using their wits, their agility, and a hefty dose of audacity. These heroes aren't necessarily armored warriors wielding legendary swords, and they don't have lands or noble titles. They are ordinary folk who rise to the challenge of the times, proving that size and strength aren't needed to come out on top. You're one of these heroes.
Like most halflings, you have found that the best way to get by in a world full of much larger creatures is to stay out of their way. Doing that might mean keeping out of their sight or staying on their good side. It might also mean keeping out of their reach, or dodging their attacks. Stealth and trickery might not be weapons and armor by themselves, but they are a useful supplement to the finest steel. Coupled with your natural daring and determination, these strengths are enough to bring you victory against any foe, no matter how large.
Compared to the legendary heroes of other races, you might come across as a scamp or a scoundrel. But the fact that you're crafty, resourceful, and sometimes sneaky doesn't make you any less of a hero. Avandra has blessed you with courage beyond question, ingenuity sufficient for any challenge, and the stealth you need to survive.

At the dawn of creation, dwarven myths say, Moradin made the race of dwarves. His firstborn had bones cut from bedrock, souls wrought from iron, and hearts carved of gleaming diamonds. These firstborn were the models after which all other dwarves were patterned.
Although the firstborn of Moradin's making vanished in servitude to the giants, their fighting techniques and mystical traditions have not been lost. A new era of dwarven heroism has arrived, and the legacy of the firstborn continues. Those few who most skillfully follow the paths of the ancient firstborn are slowly transformed into the image of Moradin's firstborn.
As one of the present-day firstborn of Moradin, you forge a deep connection with the earth, tapping into the power that courses through the bedrock beneath your feet. You draw on the strength of the mountains to resist injury, expand your senses through rock and stone, and root yourself in the bones of the earth. You are the stuff new legends are made of.

The gnome race has learned to survive in a dangerous world by remaining unnoticed, staying out of sight and wielding magic to become invisible. As a fey beguiler, you take that a step farther, using magic to cloud and confuse your enemies' minds while you perfect your own talents for stealth and secrecy.
	As you progress along the path of the fey beguiler, you learn an array of methods to move around unseen while bedeviling your foes. You can turn invisible, blast your foe with a globe of fey light and dash away unseen, or dumbfound an opponent, leaving it vulnerable to your allies' attacks. To supplement the powers of your path and your class, you also learn skills and utility powers typically available to rogues and wizards, either magical or mundane tricks to enhance your stealth, movement, or other capabilities. The key to your success is to escape notice, and you have an arsenal of techniques to do just that.
	You can be sly and sneaky, moving quietly and skulking through the shadows. Subtlety is a valuable tool, and secrecy can save your life. But sometimes a forthright attack on an enemy's mind is just the right tool for the job.

In the veins of your people flows the mingled blood of orcs and humans, a perfect union of ferocity and adaptability. In general, half-orcs manifest the best traits of humans and orcs. In your heart, though, orc drums beat a call to war, stirring a savage craving for violence. You brim with fury you can barely contain, and in the thick of combat it overflows into a raging torrent. Only battle can feed the hunger in your soul, for you were born to the bloodfury.
For your entire life, you have felt the stirrings of war within you, the conflict between the human and orc halves that define your divided nature. From the battle raging inside, you derive great power, great strength, and above all, a great capacity for destruction. In combat, you lose yourself to the storm, unleashing your bloodfury in a frothing display of violence that inspires fear in all who fight you.

The unknown has an inexplicable hold on you. Your greatest ambition is to discover, to unearth, to explore. You are the perfect expression of the human tendency to comb the world in search of knowledge and power, infused with an almost superhuman determination. This determination is central to your nature—a drive that propels you to work harder, fight longer, and strive for more than you should be able to attain through your own merits. You are not satisfied until you have achieved complete victory in your endeavors, and you develop powers to help you achieve your goals. Your will only grows stronger when your back is against the wall, and you fight all the harder, making sure you win the day.
Whether you are motivated by a thirst for knowledge of the world's most ancient civilizations, a hunger for long-lost secrets of arcane power, a drive to conquer and settle the world in the name of Erathis, or a lust for gold and glory, you're willing to face great danger to achieve your goals. Thanks to your singleminded dedication, you usually manage to escape from danger in one piece, even if you survive only by the skin of your teeth.

Although their purpose in training you was to aid them in liberating the isle of Oman, you've found that their techniques are very applicable to other enemies as well. In addition to learning how to effectively fight giants, the Northlanders taught you a bit about sailing and the sea.

You are one of a few brave souls that strike out into Thay, using your stealth and holy might to protect yourself as you pursue your mission. Sometimes you're asked to reconnoiter for the army, other times you're sent in to recover a lost object or rescue an abducted citizen before he or she succumbs to a dark fate.
	You serve as an expert guide to any team you accompany into the undead realm of Thay, and your natural leadership helps you navigate your group to your objective as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Champions of order, law, and justice, Sons of Mercy are common sights on Sigil's streets, but more and more, they range farther from the great city. They might take root in Astral dominions, raise citadels in the Feywild or Shadowfell, or found great bastions to combat lawlessness in the Elemental Chaos. They are symbols of order, champions of law who uphold justice wherever they travel. Sons of Mercy might be found among any group that splintered away from Sigil's Mercykillers during the Faction War, not just the faction that still bears that name.
	You identify lawbreakers and fight to bring them to justice, whether that be swift execution or capture for questioning. You turn your attention to one target at a time and are single-minded in that pursuit, chasing down the fugitive until justice is served. Those who break the laws have good reason to fear you on the battlefield.

Many wizards study the ways of dragons. What better source of ancient lore and potent magic, after all, than creatures capable of living a thousand years or more? You, too, have chosen to study these great beasts, but because you believe them a menace or a great evil. For whatever reason, you hone your spells to best counter and destroy the legendary creatures.

The world contains few sources of wealth greater than a dragon's hoard. While most consider it suicide to target a hoard for theft, some rogues consider these targets the ultimate challenge. You count yourself among these thrillseekers, “liberating” gold and magic items from the lairs of great dragons, and possibly leaving a dead dragon in your wake as well.

Many of the gods harbor a special hatred for dragons, or at least those dragons who do not share their alignment
and worldview. They have not forgotten Io's arrogance, his refusal to work alongside them in their battle against the Primordials. As such, when a cleric devotes herself to battling these monstrous creatures, many of the gods have provided ceremonies and rites to imbue that cleric with extra powers. When you use your Scourge of Io powers, your eyes briefly take on slitted pupils and a gleam of inner power.

You have communed with the spirits of the land and have been found worthy of the horned champion's mantle. You transcend the flesh you were born with to become the chosen vessel of nature's spirits. Your duty is to take up arms against the fell creatures of the land, to put an end to their destruction, and to restore the splendor of the untamed wilds.
Becoming a horned champion is a transformative experience. Gone are the simple concerns that bound you to the world. You see the world on a grander scale, as an organism that must be protected against the abominations that would siphon its strength for dark purposes. You appear to have no ties to people or places, only to your weighty mission, leading many to feel as though you lack understanding of the individual's plight. Although it's true that you care little for the individual's suffering, giving no more attention to a mortal's difficulties than one would show to an insect, your concern encompasses the natural world and all things living in it. Thus, in a way, your ties to others are deeper than friendship, for they are forged from the bonds that connect all living things.

The fury of Baphomet is at the root of your people's creation. His demonic rage is still connected to you and yours, giving strength. In your line of work, the allure of increased might is a temptation too great to resist. You learned to tap hatred and wrath to lay your enemies low. Fury is your friend when steel rings, and the cries of the wounded and dying fill the air. The grim majesty of combat quickens your minotaur soul. What began as your hesitant step in the direction of savagery has become a full run toward your inner beast. You refuse to pay homage to Baphomet, but you don't turn away from his gifts. Why should you, when you can use the demon lord's own weapons against him? Still, the desire to kill sometimes threatens to overwhelm you. Your body ripples with power, and you become more beastly as time passes. Should you question the wisdom of your decision?

You are a beacon in the darkness, one who reveals the way, and a guardian of the dead. Through your holy works, you ensure that the souls of the dead move on, free of fear and remorse, and unimpeded by sinister entities that would use them for dark deeds. You harbor a special hatred for undead, seeing them as perversions of the natural order.
	Visions of past lives—leftover fragments from those you have saved—haunt your dreams. Although the sights are unsettling, they renew your commitment to guard the souls from the dangers lurking between this world and the next.
	When you use your soul guide powers, ephemeral bits of soul materialize and swirl about you.

Malec-Keth janissaries are products of the elite arcane and military practices taught in the Tower of Malec-Keth, a war-magic academy in the City of Brass. Highly disciplined and rigorously trained, Malec-Keth janissaries have a fighting style demonstrative of their mastery of mind and body. They learn offensive and defensive techniques to protect their wards, and they also study music, art, and language.
	Many Malec-Keth janissaries are servants to powerful masters, both humanoid and elemental. Proud and loyal, janissaries are single-minded in defense of their allies and masters. They favor a modest appearance; the only distinguishing mark a janissary bears is the tattoo of single blue flame on the brow that declares him or her a graduate of Malec-Keth. Those who wear the mark of Malec-Keth are known far and wide among the elemental realms for their determination and deadly skill with spell and blade.
	Many powerful lords and ladies favor janissaries as bodyguards for their defensive abilities. Other Malec- Keth janissaries owe allegiance to no master, preferring to use their training to further their own ambitions.

	You are a descendant of the survivors of Cendriane's mysterious cataclysm, or you have been tutored in the martial secrets of that realm. You have perfected the use of fey step and the art of double-wielding longswords.

This self-knowledge combined with your blade mastery makes you a transient adversary on the battlefield, disappearing and reappearing as necessary.

The devastation of the thunderstorm howls in your soul, wild and untamed. You thrill in the chaos of battle, your wrath unquenched and uncontrollable. Battle, for you, is not a means to an end; it is an end in itself. The thrill of combat draws you on, and wounds only drive you to greater frenzy.
Caught in the tumult of your anger, you must attack—calculated maneuvers and intricate strategies are diversions. You attack with sweeping blows that cleave through your enemies or lock single foes in deadly exchanges that can end only in the death of one or the other of you. When the furor of battle seizes you, you ignore pain and keep fighting when others would fall, an unconquerable whirlwind of destruction.

Each drow character is born into darkness and then burdened with the Corellon's curse and Lolth's blessing. The curse manifests in their enslavement to the Spider Queen, while the blessing represents the goddess's filthy touch, a gift ensuring the drow remain in her service. Drow can use only a portion of Lolth's power, manifesting it into clouds of darkness or limning their enemies with purple flame, but a few drow are powerful enough to expand their talents in other areas. These drow learn to unlock the hidden reserves of their curse and exploit them to achieve greater results.
	As a curseborn, you have awakened hidden powers within you. Whether you believe these powers are further gifts granted to you by the Spider Queen or are a permutation of your existing abilities granted by Lolth's touch, or even a revelation based on your efforts to find redemption, the results are the same. Your Lolthtouched powers are intensified, your darkness is alive with umbral strands of shadow, and your ability to create darkfire is magnified to encompass to affect a number of enemies. In addition, you also learn methods of using Lolth's gifts in superior ways, from burning your foes with the flames of darkness to sliding into the Shadowfell to cloak your body with tendrils of darkness.
	Your evolution into a curseborn results in a subtle transformation that is unnoticeable except when you are using your curseborn or Lolthtouched powers. Each time you tap into these abilities, your bright eyes flare, casting your face into ghastly shadows, while tiny black spiders composed of living shadow scurry off to vanish into puffs of acrid smoke. None of these features interferes with your other abilities, but drow recognize you as being kissed by the Spider Queen.

The folktale of Jarret the Twiceborn is told throughout the lands. Although humans and elves cherish this  celebrated figure, many other peoples speak of him with reverence. Tales differ about his actual heritage, human or half-elf. It is known that he was born to common folk outside elf lands in a kingdom that would one day be part of the empire of Nerath.
	Jarret's natural charm won him friends above his station, including young nobles with little or no chance of inheritance. As a result, Jarret gained martial training and took to forming groups of do-gooders and fortune seekers. His ability to lead these small bands to success against all odds came to be well documented. He and his comrades traveled widely and are credited with making life safer in many places. Jarret's companions seldom left the adventuring life for any reason other than significant wealth; certainly death was not the primary reason.
	Jarret wasn't so lucky. He fell in battle against the mind flayers of Thoon deep within the Underdark. No magic could bring him back.
	The story doesn't end there, however. Many believe Jarret was reborn as a lad of the same name who grew up in nearly the same place. This perhaps-reincarnated Jarret became an inspiring leader and hero like his namesake. He performed similar deeds, and never refuted claims that he was the same Jarret. Instead, he used the rumor to his advantage, renewing former ties of friendship and striking fear into old enemies. He became known for taking special interest in opposing aberrant creatures, such as mind flayers. Those who knew and loved him eventually dubbed him Jarret the Twiceborn. Yarns say he lives still in the heavens, alongside great generals from times past.
	Jarret's accomplishments and methods are recorded in story, history, and song. From these, many venturesome souls draw inspiration and try to duplicate Jarret's feats. Some successful imitators even claim to teach his methods.
	Maybe your natural talents led you on a road similar to Jarret's. You've taken what you could from folktales and, perhaps, teachers. In your travails, you carry on Jarret's folk-hero tradition. In doing so, perhaps you'll become even greater than the Twiceborn.

The Feywild, home of the eladrin, is a wondrous reflection of the world. Within that plane, beauty thrives that defies the worldly mind, but so too does evil. Eladrin are as prone to wickedness as humans are, and in a bygone age, the drow were also natives of the Feywild.
	In a time long before other great empires, eladrin faithful to Corellon fought bitter wars within the Feywild against the followers of Lolth and other evil fey. These wars culminated in what came to be known as the Last Battle of the Spiral Tower. During that clash, the Corellon loyalists finally turned the tide and a hero was born.
	Ossandrya was an eladrin squad commander when the Last Battle of the Spiral Tower began. Drow and demons had taken the mythic site during a protracted battle that saw the eladrin fighting on many fronts. Several fruitless assaults on the enemy-held tower cost Ossandrya's superiors their lives. With reinforcements unavailable, the eladrin commander was forced to lead the remaining troops against the drow. She devised a multipronged attack that utilized the eladrin's fey step, taking the biggest risks on herself and having no regard for the tower's ultimate fate. In the end, Ossandrya's efforts proved successful. Although the Spiral Tower was reduced to a blackened spindle bereft of magic, the eladrin drove the drow out for good.
	In time, the Spiral Tower was rebuilt. Ossandrya, who survived other campaigns that drove the drow out of the Feywild, eventually passed from the mortal realm. She is counted among legendary warlords. Within the ruins of the Spiral Tower, her story is recorded. Eladrin warriors across the Feywild study her brilliant strategies and tactics, many of which require fey powers.
	You have studied Ossandrya's story and schemes, or you have intuited similar ploys thanks to your fey nature. It could be that some combination of these possibilities influenced your course in life. You have a strongly tactical mind, a sharp sense of space and timing, and the ability to adapt your powers to tactical needs. These aptitudes serve you well in your battles, leading you toward the acclaim Ossandrya has long possessed.

Bahamut requires his devotees to protect the innocent and the weak. Those who revere the Platinum Dragon are ever watchful for the rise of evil, and in particular the followers of Tiamat. Negotiation with Tiamat's forces is rarely useful and often fatal. The tenets of justice also require adherents of Bahamut's faith to oppose injustice and despotism. Although the metallic dragon god is a lover of peace, his laws regularly require battles and crusades.
	Many valiant folk who serve Bahamut are paladins or clerics. But Bahamut spurns no noble soul's offer of service. Even those without divine investiture have a place in the effort to bring Bahamut's light to theworld's gloomy places. Secular leaders who venerate Bahamut  lend power to the Platinum Dragon's cause by ensuring order, honor, and justice in worldly institutions.
	Temples dedicated to honorable battle invariably include Bahamut among the gods respected. Such places teach techniques and values aimed at bringing virtue to the world by example rather than by exhortation. Those sent to learn are often warriors or nobles bound for a nation's military.
	Perhaps you came to Bahamut through such schooling. Other good-hearted people find the Platinum Dragon's ways through personal devotion or study, or even providence. Bahamut willingly instills a small measure of divine grace in those who show true commitment. Your heroic deeds and pure heart have proven you to be worthy of Bahamut's blessing. So you carry Bahamut's mark, using his minor gifts to protect, heal, and shine forth as a model of justice.

Bael Turath's armies were warlike beyond mortal measure. Backed by the power of the Nine Hells, the leaders of the tiefling empire thought their forces could overcome any challenge. And in fact the legions of Bael Turath were often victorious, a testament to their officers as much as their supernatural might.
	The most infamous of Bael Turath's generals was a tiefling known today as Malachi. As a lower-ranking officer in campaigns of conquest, Malachi proved to be a disciplined and innovative commander, renowned for being able to adapt to any situation. He watched and learned from his enemies, changed tactics at pivotal moments, and regularly used what he knew of his enemies against them. Malachi never knew defeat until he faced forces under the command of Dhuryan Flamebrow of Arkhosia.
	Stories differ on what happened next. Some say Arkhosia's leaders put Malachi to death. Others claim that he retired alongside Dhuryan, whom he befriended. A few claim that Malachi now marshals the forces of the Nine Hells.
	Whatever his fate, Malachi's brilliance is the root of a tradition of battlefield leadership that has spread across the world. A collection of writings from Bael Turath known as The Hellpath Tome supposedly preserves a portion of Malachi's own writings. You might have benefited from such education. Perhaps your leanings led you on a crafty path much like Malachi's. Whatever your background, you know how to conjure victory from situations most dire.

A dragon driven to wrath is a terrifying foe. It stops at nothing to quench its fury in the blood of those who wronged it. Only the desire to protect its young can drive a dragon to even greater heights of recklessness. A dragonborn warrior is little different, and a dragonborn officer displays parental loyalty to those alongside whom he fights. Such is the dragonborn warrior ideal.
	An exemplar of this standard was Dhuryan Flamebrow, an audacious but beloved dragonborn mercenary from the fringes of the empire of Arkhosia. Dhuryan was noble born, but upon him fell the consequences of his father's dark deeds. Without title or property in the empire, and living under the shadow of family history, he made his way as a soldier and leader. He made a habit of leading from the front with a brashness born of being indifferent to death. Glory and the erasing of the past was his overriding aim, yet he was unwilling to sacrifice his fellow fighters for his own gain.
	Dhuryan succeeded in reshaping the armies of a border province known for its barbarism and monster problems. Eventually, that province and its dragon lord became the most prominent in Arkhosia, although only Dhuryan's name is widely remembered to this day. At long last, Dhuryan had cleansed his family name. He rose then to prominence as a military advisor and became a general in the wars that eventually destroyed Arkhosia. During this time, he penned the military manifesto titled Flamebrow, in honor of his clan. Myths from many cultures say that Dhuryan fought in numerous wars in this world and beyond, and that he fell but returned to life more than once. Tales say that he stands now beyond the touch of time, alongside other legendary generals, awaiting the world's need.
	Flamebrow still exists, copied into many languages. It is a treatise for the commander who wishes to defeat enemies head-on. Although it speaks of deceptive planning and long-term strategies, it also talks of brutal efficiency and courageous leadership when battle is joined.
	Whether through influence, reading and practice, or direct training, your path has been influenced by Flamebrow. Boldness of action fails to fully describe your methods. You act decisively, willing to lay your own survival on the line to get the job done and protect your allies.

A connection to the earth defines dwarves as a connection to woodlands defines elves. All dwarves intuitively heed the earth's example, from the sustenance and riches it provides to the inexorable might of the landslide it spawns. Dwarf bodies are durable; more than once they've been compared to the dirt and stone that dwarves treasure. Any would-be dwarf hero does well to take advantage of this natural sturdiness.
	Innate toughness is a hallmark of dwarf soldiers and their leaders. Vigor makes for a soldier who can outlast the enemy by withstanding hardship and injury. A robust officer pushes troops onward not only with words, but also by determined example. Dwarf warriors are renowned for their endurance.
	Bergrom Earthfast, a dwarf general of legend, exemplifies the ideal dwarf warlord. Mighty in body and mind, Bergrom led his troops against giants before dwarves became free from the slavery of the titans. He endured supernatural elements, fell magic, and the treacherous wilds of old to help bring freedom to his people. His legacy endures in a martial tradition that values a sturdy body and the ability to get one's allies to make the most of their own endurance, as much as it does tactical acumen. Although Bergrom was a dwarf and relied on dwarven resilience, his techniques have spread to other peoples. Anyone who values toughness and spirit in a soldier might learn these ancient methods.
	You are such a leader. Even if you didn't acquire formal training in Bergrom's leadership approach—or aren't a dwarf—your talents have led you in a similar direction. Relying on a hardy constitution and heavy weapons as tools, you help your allies push the limits of mortal endurance. Your enemies are hard pressed to keep up.

Progress, taming of the wilds for the good of all, innovation, collaboration, and the rule of law—these are the values Erathis has set before mortals. Yet the nature of the world opposes her. Empires rise like beacons only to be shattered within a few centuries, leaving flickering shards of civilization behind. Still, in each age, a mighty and ambitious few rise to beat back the shadows and create a safe haven for common folk.
	Those who follow Erathis's edicts range from plucky adventurers who rid the wilderness of dangers to would-be lords who subdue untamed lands to call their own. The god of civilization delights in the expansion of organized habitation. She blesses those who boldly make way for progress, as well as those who defend existing societies against fell beasts.
	To truly and fully take Erathis's dogma to heart is to embrace both cooperation and leadership. You must be educated in the ways of governance and regulation, as well as be cognizant of the follies of history that ravaged the cultures of old. You must look outside the confines of secure walls and take Erathis's banner to new territory. To sit idly within the halls of established civilized edifices simply won't do.
	So far, you have proven to be one of the few who can undertake this mission. You know that a true leader must be an authority in combat and in peace, but also be a guide who elicits the help of capable collaborators. You cultivate camaraderie, planning a meaningful role for all in battle and outside it. You have polished your party into the perfect cohesive unit, proven by the extraordinary heights at which it performs under your guidance. Now, it's time to move onward to broader conquest and, perhaps, your own dominion.

Within the Elemental Chaos, disparate elements battle for supremacy. In numerous places, the land, sky, and sea roil in a never-ending clash of lightning and fire, poison gas and rolling earth, biting water and tearing wind. The chaos is much like a worldly battlefield on which no leader exerts control. Where one element dominates, the will of a mighty force of nature is often what makes it so.
	The unrestrained chaos is much like a worldly battlefield on which no skilled leader exerts control. In such a combat zone, forces clash without clear direction. The tide of battle is all too often determined merely by fate. Clear advantage on one side or the other can rarely be overcome. One side overwhelms the other by happenstance or because of uneven odds. Victory is won at too heavy a cost.
	A mythological genasi general of the ancient world, Vyn-kazi, knew the price of warfare's chaos all too well. She had witnessed it. Like the entropic realm from which they sprang, the great Primordials warred with the gods with no common purpose and no organization—no plan at all. Most of these mighty beings were fractious and grasping loners with armies of fierce slaves. They all but allowed the gods to coordinate against them. One by one, each and its armies succumbed to the gods and their legions.
	Vyn-kazi survived a disastrous battle in which her master, Nekal of the Glowing Deep, fell against a host that included Pelor, Kord, Bane, Ioun, and Sehanine. The watersoul genasi went on to swear fealty to Pelor and to take on a firesoul aspect in his name. She then led her people against other Primordials in service to the god of the sun, taking the calm blending of two elements in her spirit and what she had witnessed in Nekal's defeat as models for her command style.
	Similar to celebrated Vyn-kazi, you have learned to mingle and control the elements that cavort in your body and spirit. Your military training has taught you how to guide a combat to triumph by blending the skills of your allies with the needs and variables of the challenge. You have applied your life's lessons to your teaching, acknowledging that every clash is a meeting of contrasting elements. By carefully mixing those forces, you need not rely on fortune for your success.

Sometimes a small squad of specially trained or highly skilled people can do what an army can't. A precise strike or a cunning raid can turn the tide in many dangerous situations. Numerous nobles and mercantile interests keep or patronize assault teams such as these for situations that call for decisive offensive action. A unit of such specialists can instead become its own employer, attacking and looting monster lairs on the borderlands and becoming rich in the process. Another such group might itself become a menace, turning superior combat prowess toward banditry or tyranny.
	The world is in a dark age. Desperate times favor resourceful people. But even bold and venturesome folk need wily leadership to thrive. Such a leader helps a team hit hard and stay mobile, avoiding obstacles, overcoming foes, and keeping one step ahead of the enemy. In fact, precision command and an eye toward stealth can make all the difference in smallsquad engagements.
	You are such a leader, whether through formal training in elite unit command or as a result of direct experience, or both. Those who observe you might say you're the team's commander, but you see yourself as an expert facilitator among able peers. You know the skills of those with whom you work, and you always have the right trick to keep the whole party in fighting shape. The cohesion you have created among your comrades has seen you through much in the past, and it speaks of your future success.

Both Kord and Bane exult in battle. Bane sends his followers to conquer and pillage, using war for the sake of unjust gain, wanton violence, or sheer bloodlust. Kord's way is one of accepting challenges as they come and using mastered talents to overcome them. His dogma is one of bravery, strength, and skill. No test of mortal mettle is stronger than the crucible of battle. The glory and fame that Kord admonishes his followers to seek involves striving to win the respect of their fellows for upholding their duty and facing danger with their heads held high.
	Warriors and warlords of all sorts esteem Kord. Those who know that fighting is sometimes necessary pray to Kord for favor, rather than to Bane. Such warriors know that it is the fate of a few to stand against senseless destruction and oppression. Kord's followers do so without flinching. They uphold the right to independence that Kord's wild nature demands. When battle is done, revelry, boasting, and toasting— celebrating life and health—are all that Kord requires as thanks.
	Numerous schools of military thought use Kord's dogma as part of their philosophy. Leaders must be strong and courageous. They must hone their talents to assure victory and survival in bloody days. Renown should be earned through bold and decisive action that serves as an example to one's comrades. A valiant warlord protects his fellow soldiers by leading from the front and luring in the enemy, as Kord did in older days.
	You are a leader who reveres Kord's ways. As such, you have shaped your skills by leading your comrades against many dangers. With a war cry, you fearlessly engage your enemies. You stride among your adversaries, seeking the greatest among them and challenging them with your amazing exploits. Your brashness inspires your allies to decisive action and helps create the opportunities in which triumph can be secured.

The world has no shortage of bullies. In every town and every neighborhood roams a lout with more muscle than sense, and more bravado than backbone. Every gang has an enforcer or a leg breaker. Yet it takes more than a mean streak and a hard head to rise above mere thuggery.
	Unlike such roughnecks, who are so often craven at heart, you have cold iron beneath your hardened visage. You have the skill and the mettle to make good on threats you offer. Intimidation, to you, is just fair warning, an omen foretelling the cost of crossing you.
	Like most of your kind, you might have started with a criminal outfit or learned how to get along in the harsh training ground of the streets. Such unsavory surroundings taught you to survive. A reputation for handing out grim rewards to your enemies slowly enabled you to avoid fights through the use of your bladed stare. For a few of you, formal training as an interrogator or operative taught you to use fear and pain as a principal means of getting the job done. In any case, fear is as useful in battle as it is outside it.
	You have set your mind to this harsh fact and have realized that most interactions are all about getting in and getting out on top. If the other guy believes you can and will hurt him if you need to, dealings are much more likely to go in your favor.
	Although stealth and subterfuge have uses, combat isn't a subtle solution. You favor techniques that keep your enemies shaken. A traumatized, fearful, or angry foe is more likely to make a mistake. Encouraging such missteps—gleefully at times—you make yourself a target through your brutality. Then you and your allies capitalize on those slip-ups to win the day.

Life is too short to take seriously. Danger lurks in every shadow, and an enemy waits behind every door. Those who spend every waking moment thinking about all the bad things that could happen never leave the house.
	Instead of wringing your hands, you throw away all your worries and take a devil-may-care attitude. Sure, some say you will end up raking the coals of the Nine Hells because of your decadent living. In the end, though, who's the happier: you and your adventurous, libertine ways or the hidebound drudge shuddering under his covers?
	On one hand, you're a charmer. Others find your infectious wit and bravado winsome. But you're also irreverent, irresponsible, and reckless. What's worst is that sometimes you have the hardest time keeping your mouth shut. Whether cracking a joke in the middle of a solemn funeral or shouting a barrage of insults at a demon, you can't help but stir up trouble. Deep down, you know life might be easier if you straightened up, but where's the fun in that?
	When you face a serious challenge, your skill with weapons comes to the fore. Your tongue and your body language become secondary instruments of derision. You seed your exploits with cutting insults and disdain, goading your enemies into overextending or making other mistakes. When an enemy gives you an opening, you press the advantage. In the end, you stand triumphantly over a fallen foe, showing once again who the greater fool is.

Among common folk, knife and shuriken throwing are forms of entertainment and sport. Competitors throw under calm conditions at stationary targets. At the extreme, carnival throwers toss blades at a moving mark, or sport throwers have to put up with rowdy onlookers and too much drink.
	It takes a special breed of warrior to specialize in throwing blades in actual combat. The clash of steel, the rush of magical forces, and the screams of the wounded and dying are far more than taproom distractions. Moreover, the idea of tossing away a weapon seems tantamount to suicide. Still, anyone who has mastered the technique of hurling blades in battle knows that doing so helps to keep one out of harm's way.
	Being such an expert takes guts, discernment, smarts, and quickness. The hurler must be brave enough to throw away a weapon, and to stand fast when the enemy recognizes the danger that he or she presents. The thrower's senses must be accurate enough to discern when to move and where. Furthermore, perception is nothing without the good judgment to exploit opportunities and to carry the right array of blades. And all this means little if the wielder lacks the agility orspeed to take advantage of whatever battle situation 
arises.
	You are such an expert with light thrown blades. Swift enough to draw weapons in rapid succession and to knock an arrow out of the air, you have little to fear when you throw a blade. Your talent allows you to hit with terrifying accuracy, to bounce your blades off one target and into another, and even to punch holes in enemy armor. You have even been known to throw so quickly that you can hit every target in your field of vision.

Deceive your prey into a weak tactical position. Strike without being seen. Kill without allowing a counterattack. Don't sever a limb when you can cut off the head. Reward your enemies with death so horrifying that all others fear to oppose you. Live to fight again. All of these are drow rules of warfare, which young drow learn well just to get by in their treacherous society.
	The drow are famous for slaughter, murdering all who get in their way. Countless folk have suffered the cruel kiss of a drow priestess's whip or the vile magic of a drow warlock. Innumerable slaves have lived and died as the wicked and capricious whims of their drow masters demanded. From this world you have come, and like others before you, you have found sanctuary in the arts of death. You learned the rudiments of drow warfare among your school-age peers. You mastered the blade-and-crossbow fighting style of the drow warrior to improve your station among your people. Better to be a valued killer than a slave or a sacrifice.
	Maybe you smelled the deceptions and half-truths in your society, put up with the lies of the Spider Queen, until you could take no more. Perhaps the internecine warfare between drow houses left you without allies in the vast Underdark. You abandoned your past. Estranged from your homeland, you joined with other wanderers and continued your training. You have sought to become death incarnate and have succeeded well beyond the normal warriors of your people.

Some people are born killers. That penchant can be channeled in as many ways as there are reasons for slaughter. Some slay for religion or creed, others for power or influence, and still others for money, vengeance, glory, or just plain relief. Many who have a knack for murder take up violent professions, from soldier or town guard to gladiator or assassin. A few, whatever their reasons, make a career out of slaying monsters.
	Killing is grim business, no matter who or what ends up dead. Nobody takes going to the grave lightly. Hands-off methods, such as poison, can sometimes work, as can stealthy techniques. Otherwise, direct and bloody conflict is the only way to go about butchery.
	Strangely, a lot of would-be killers think that combat has rules. You know differently: In battle, fair play, honor, and mercy are for chumps. Fighting is all about dancing with death and being one of those still standing when the music ends. Maybe you came by your “philosophy” while being schooled as an assassin or hired sword. Of course, an adventurer's life has plenty of object lessons along the same lines: Kill or be killed.
	When you start a fight, you take a little time to size up the competition. After that, it's all bloody business. If someone has the nerve to attack you, you make that fool pay in such a way that anyone watching will think twice about facing you. Nobody escapes you unless they have the ability to take you out of the fight, or you want the story of your prowess to get around.
	However you gained your skills, they are honed in accordance with your brutal creed. Those who go up against you risk everything. As proven by the boost you sometimes get from brutalizing our adversaries, you take at least a little pleasure in your work.

Acrobatics is a widespread and popular talent. All people, from nobles to peasants, enjoy acrobatics shows, whether amid the finery of court or the debris of the street. A few venturesome religious rites, especially those that pay homage to Avandra or Kord, require the skill. Mastery of the body is part of numerous education philosophies, and acrobatics is unmatched in cultivating fitness and balance. Thieves and burglars use the skill to ply their trade. Training is easy to find and widely accepted. Some youngsters attain a level of mastery well before they reach adolescence.
	Not to be underestimated is the value of such proficiency on the battlefield. A combatant who is adept at acrobatics can maneuver like no other. The adroit use of the skill opens up advantages that other warriors can't attain and allows the acrobat to avoid being pinned down. Movement becomes quicker and smoother as the acrobat uses the whole body as a tool, rather than just relying on the feet and the legs. It's obvious why some martial training includes instruction in acrobatics.
	It's also clear that the adventurer has even more use for acrobatics than a warrior or a soldier does. Explorers routinely face perils that are best overcome with agility, poise, and a sense of one's body. More than one fortune seeker owes life and limb to his dedicated schooling in acrobatics.
	To say that of you is a gross understatement, however. It doesn't matter if you came by your skill in a formal academy, from family tradition, or through the school of hard knocks. You have made acrobatics not only an art form, but also a martial style all your own.
	You flabbergast friend and foe alike with your talent. Using it, you routinely accomplish tricks that seem beyond mortal capacity. With your flamboyant derring-do, you deliver terrible attacks and deftly capitalize on the smallest openings.

The advantage of getting the drop on an enemy is acknowledged far and wide. Equally prized is the benefit of  taking out important targets with little risk. No one is better at accomplishing either task than a trained sharpshooter, and the sharpshooter's weapon of choice is the crossbow.
	Nations and mercenary groups train specialized soldiers to use crossbows in this fashion. Underworld organizations do the same. Any such soldier is essentially an assassin who knows how to use a crossbow to slay from a distance without attracting notice. Dwarves in particular prize this exception to their normally straightforward battle tactics. That race produces fine snipers.
	Such shooters don't shy away from a normal fight. They understand that reconnaissance and a plan, along with the ability to strike unseen from a great distance, are great advantages in a combat situation. A good ambush leaves the enemy weakened and confused, giving any follow up assault a better chance of working.
	You have chosen to hone your skills along these lines. You prefer to strike from hiding with a wellplaced shot and to remain unobserved during a confrontation, aiding your allies by picking off foes without ever drawing notice. The hand crossbow is your preferred weapon.
	Sniping is the ultimate tactic for you. The sound of a bolt finding its target is the sweet toll of victory. A bolt you fire might take out a sentry in a single hit, as well as sending your enemies scurrying for cover. If you miss, no matter. You can slink back into the shadows until you have a chance to shoot again.

Independence, courage, and quickness of mind and body—the cat symbolizes all of these traits. It prefers to watch the world carefully from a good vantage before acting decisively. Normally calm and fastidiously clean, a feline loves to play but fights fearlessly when it must. It is a stealthy hunter that specializes in ambushes and deadly rushes, finishing its prey as quickly as possible. When surrounded by friends, the cat is industrious and protective, sharing what it has.
	You see yourself in the cat, or a little of the cat in yourself. You too are a careful and swift hunter, with catlike grace and bravery. Surprise and swift attacks are your specialty, and few compare to you in your self-sufficiency.
	Maybe that's why you chose a wild cat as a companion (or perhaps it was the cat that picked you). You have developed your feline qualities, growing in awareness, slyness, and sneakiness. Your beast companion has become a strong warrior at your side, using its predatory skills to bring down your common adversaries as if they were game.
	As word of your deeds spreads, your cat's fame grows with yours. It has become an emblem that identifies you among those you meet, affect, and oppose. When your story is done, your cat will stand beside you in mythic chronicles, as if you and it were one.

Like their eladrin cousins, elves have the time and the will to give everything they do a complex expression. To them, something worth doing at all is worth doing better than well—it's worth total dedication of body, mind, and soul. Any task merits mastering to the extent that the very process of doing it, even in training, is beautiful. Further, to the fey mind, combining seemingly disparate arts and joys into one form creates something more beautiful in the end. This is as true of archery as it is of any other activity.
	Ages ago, after they entered the world and became separated from the eladrin, elves found it necessary to survive in the hostile wilds. Grace and awareness became their strengths. The bow became their chosen weapon for hunting and stealthy warfare.
	The magic flowing in the fey soul has enabled more than one elf to forge a spiritual tie with the bow. Such archers are practiced at engaging targets in dense forests and areas fraught with cover. The sound of an enemy bowstring being drawn or the hint of movement in the undergrowth is enough to draw a reactive shot faster than any intended attack can come. A master of elven archery easily deals with multiple foes, and in time develops the uncanny ability to make arrows literally track their targets. Elven arrows can be said literally to have an enemy's name on them.
	You carry on this glorious tradition. Stalking in untamed and dangerous places armed with only quiver and bow, you have become an exemplar of elven marksmanship. Your finely honed senses are second to none, and your aim is ever true. Among the most formidable of hunters, you have a shooting expertise that transcends the mundane skill of other archers. Your spirit reaches out to inform you of the unseen. If your skill and your amazing deeds carry you farther, elves who come to the way of the bow after you will hold you as the example that guides them.

Mastery of a chosen armament is a long standing tradition among many peoples. Legends are full of examples: the fighter who is one with his sword or the assassin who can't miss with knives. Fables also tell of those who have consummate proficiency with the bow or the crossbow. Some warriors acquire skill with the bow to avoid close combat. Others do so because ability and purpose lead them that way. Archers work for all sorts of causes, military to mercenary, noble to malevolent. One example is the battlefield archer (Player's Handbook), a tactical shooter that works well in the chaos of small-unit combat.
	Unlike other archers, the sharpshooter's purpose is to become legendary for accuracy and skill, as well as for the number and sorts of foes defeated. Quick shooting, accuracy, and deadliness are the sharpshooter's trademarks, along with the ability to use a bow or a crossbow in ways that few others can. Some who would become the ultimate sharpshooter look for other archers to challenge in contests of skill or even in duels to the death.
	You have honed your bow or crossbow skills with a desire to become the best of the best. You fire faster than most folk would think possible. When enemies try to move in close and shut you down, you shoot on without compromising defense. Those who watch you work could swear your arrows are alive. One day, you'll be targeting that one enemy whose defeat will make you a legend.

For a mundane hunter or a common would-be hero, ordinary animals and beastlike monsters are worthy prey. Regardless of what such a creature is physically capable of, or the wrongs it's responsible for, it has only raw instinct or brutish cunning to use against its antagonist. Reaction is its only course. The beast lacks the abilities to reason and to plan, which are required for any but the most mindless of evil acts.
	Humanoid creatures seldom suffer from this lack, this banality. Even a semblance of human intelligence, combined with the ability to use weapons and other skills, makes an adversary that much more dangerous. From common goblins to demon lords and deities, the most numerous wicked creatures in the cosmos live inside various humanoid frames. The form is similar enough in each instance that knowledge of one is a help against another, no matter how different the seeming. Malevolent or not, few creatures offer the challenge that a humanoid quarry does.
	Long ago, whether for vengeance, righteousness, or pure gamesmanship, you chose to specialize in facing and taking out humanoid foes. You excel at tracking and opposing such canny foes, slaying the many who deserve death and retrieving a few for reward, profit, or justice. For you, the understanding of anatomy, the inflicting of pain, and the invoking of fear are weapons as effective as sword or bow.
	You've been so successful that you have developed  a merciless reputation. The mention of your name inspires terror among those who know they must face you. One day, you're sure, a humanoid adversary of mythic scope will tremble at your approach.

Humanoids have taken clever beasts as companions since the beginning of time. The most prevalent among such  animals are those from the canine family. Like humanoids, canines have a cooperative mentality and an established social order. It's not surprising that nearly every humanoid race that has the option to do so—from humans to goblins, eladrin to gnolls—keeps hounds or doglike beasts as pets.
	Myth holds that, just as humanoids have adopted canines, so too have canines adopted humanoids. One such story is the tale of Kurngarl, or Kurn the Hunter. Soon enough after the fall of the tiefling empire that the hatred of that race was still widespread, unnamed human parents bore a tiefling child. The parents left the babe in an enchanted wood to die of exposure. By some twist of destiny—or, certain versions say, by Melora's fickle mercies—wolves found the infant instead. Yunulf, “the Lady of the Wolves,” added the human child to her litter, naming him Horned Man.
	Kurngarl developed uncanny skills with nature while living with his wolf family, learning from a variety of other animals as well. Eventually, a dwarf explorer named Fargrim found Kurngarl and took the tiefling child to the ancient dwarven hold of Durigirn. The young tiefling then became a citizen of the dwarven hold and roamed the wilderness surrounding it. Even so, he acknowledged no dwarven name in place of the one his wolf mother had given him. That he translated literally into Dwarven, accepting only the nickname Kurn as an alternative.
	Kurngarl had many adventures, almost all with his wolf brother Grabor by his side. Kurn and Grabor were renowned as hunters and trackers among the dwarves of Durigirn. They are also mentioned in the legends of other races, enjoying a heroic reputation for battling monsters, especially gnolls and giants. Kurn the Hunter is reputed to have turned the animals of the wilderness against unjust people in civilized areas. As such, he is held as an example by Melora's followers.
	Despite differences in your life's history, like Kurn, you have a preternatural connection with a canine beast. You and your companion function as a deadly unit among the larger pack made up of your other allies. For its part, your companion has taken cues from you, developing a level of competence and guile rivaling that of some humanoids. You have taken the wildness of the wolf into your spirit. Those who observe the two of you together find it hard to tell where the line between humanoid and beast is drawn.

The world is vast, with few mapped places. It begs exploration, instilling wanderlust in brave hearts. Roving it is a test of skill and stamina, an ordeal that rewards the intrepid with amazing sights, exciting encounters, and more. Still, the world is only one place in the broader cosmos. Other planes also beckon to the curious wanderer. The trials and experiences they offer can defy the worldly imagination and force adaptation beyond mortal ken.
	Horizon walker is the traditional name for a ceaseless roamer who seeks the unexplored regions of the universe. The appellation applies to members of a loose confederation of warriors who recognize one another as comrades on life's wondrous journey. Such travelers go from place to place, from plane to plane, developing their skills and a mystic connection with the environment. They return changed by their contact with other realms, and with knowledge to better protect the world most mortals know.
	Like most horizon walkers, you have traveled the world. You learned about it and protect its inhabitants from otherworldly threats. Then you fearlessly set out into the wider universe, using your skills and the magical nature of your tie to the world to develop similar bonds with the far reaches of creation. To this day, you're incapable of staying in one place long. Unseen locales summon you with their mystery. Your destiny whispers to you from an unknown vista. Each step you take moves you closer to it.

Although you're a being of this world, you're cursed to carry the mark of an infernal pact made by your mortal ancestors. The weight of that heritage rests heavy on your soul. Yours has been the life of one apart—a life marred by the prejudice of others and of battle against foul creatures spawned from darkness.
	You have long seen similar darkness within yourself, hiding it to avoid the hate of bigots or revealing it to evoke horror in your enemies. You have sought the ancient secrets of your people. You have overcome evil dreams and vile impulses to master your inner nature. Finally, you have tapped sinister knowledge of your immortal forebears to aid you in your quests.
	It's irrelevant whether you obtained these secrets in catacombs once lost to the ravages of time, within your own being, or from tormenting visions. The point is that you've learned to unleash some of your hidden potential by speaking words of power that few mortals know. With the baleful utterances you have learned, you can unleash pain, fire, and shadow. You can transform yourself momentarily into a form like that of your greatest ancestors and take to the air.
	The darkness you have allowed to creep into your being now colors your exploits. Your heroic acts and your reputation, as well as those of your comrades, are tainted by the devilish legacy you have willingly tapped.

When the deities first called upon their mortal followers to take up arms against the primordials, the first giantslayers were among the heroes who joined the angelic legions. Not all who fought giants were deemed slayers, but a tough corps of warriors faced giants successfully time and again, thus earning the moniker their descendants use with pride to this day. They developed a battle style that proved effective against creatures larger than human size, as numerous monstrous beings are.
	The giantslayer is, then, an intrepid warrior prepared to face enormous foes. Although plenty of other martial paths have more mundane applications, only the gutsy and the venturesome bother to train as giantslayers. Skill in a broad range of weaponry makes taking out big foes easier. Ranged attacks can hit the eyes or other hard-to-reach areas; melee weapons can be used to take out the legs, cutting a gigantic creature down to manageable size. Such a warrior is ever resourceful.
	A giantslayer must also acknowledge that gruesome death is a possible end to his or her vocation. This fact, combined with the sheer audacity required for the job, means that most giantslayers are larger-than-life figures. Those who claim the title of giantslayer have a reputation for fighting hard and playing hard. Those who share the calling respect each other. Legitimate slayers police the ranks for charlatans, following up on rumors of fake giantslayers.
	When it comes to being a giantslayer, you are the genuine article. Maybe you learned the trade from a mentor. Although some military organizations incorporate such techniques, no formalized tradition of giant slaying exists. The lessons learned on your past adventures might have been all the instruction you need. Fast, tough, and courageous, you know what it takes to cut down big opponents—even if that means going for a ride on one.

To most mortals, an animal is a pet or a tool, a companion or a means to an end. Such creatures provide food, labor, protection, and even company. Only in rare cases does the relationship between master and beast transcend these mundane trappings. Every beastmaster is an exception to this generality, learning to become one formidable unit with an animal that is at once a friend, a guardian, and a weapon. Beastmasters know that, after the bond is formed, the capabilities and fate of master and beast are linked.
	Beastmasters among many races have nurtured the mystical connection between master and pet. They cultivated communication that transcends speech and approaches telepathy. As such a beastmaster grew in power, the magic of the world infused the relationship. It bound the animal and mortal closer together, driven to do so by the devotion, ritual connection, and common cause the two shared. Contact among peoples spread this technique, which some claim originated with elves.
	Elf or not, you've managed to foster such a transcendent relationship with your beast companion. Although each of you is fiercely independent and deadly, you share emotions and thoughts. Each knows when the other is in need. You work in unison to fell your foes, and even your allies swear you act to support each other more quickly than any communication could possibly allow. In time, you might grow so close as to seem like one incredible being sharing two bodies.

Halflings have long used music and a sense of fun to enliven physical labor and various dull tasks. When the race was young, they created dancelike movements that mimicked martial skills—and translated into deadliness in melee. Halflings learned that bladed weapons lent themselves easily to such a refined use. As their battle dances evolved, halflings began to consider the nimble use of a pair of bladed weapons a refinement of the style.
	Halflings came to call skilled practitioners of this dual-weapon method blade dancers. The mingling of itinerant halflings with other peoples eventually made the blade dance famous. The blade-dancer way spread far and wide, and other folk adapted it to new weapon types. Today, numerous people know and teach the essentials of the method. The strictest masters require the student to show proficiency in combat as well as a love of life and wandering like that of halflings.
	Halfling or not, you have put your body through a grueling regimen to attain mastery of the blade dance. Twin blades twirl about you like deadly veils. Intricate footwork allows you to dance in and out of danger with ease. Your weapons, like good dance partners, know where you want them to go almost before you do. One day, you and your weapons might dance your way into legend.

The Feywild sings with eldritch energy. It is infused with magic from its twilight sky to its sparkling depths. Fey  creatures, its children, are bathed in its supernatural flow. Even the simplest among them have powers beyond those of worldly mortals, bestowing simple tasks with an otherworldly enchantment.
	Eladrin are among the heritors of the Feywild's nature. As humans and other races tamed portions of the world, so too did the eladrin subdue parts of the Feywild according to their fey temperament. They evolved a complex society, rich in crafts and traditions that also sing in concordance with the Feywild. As followers of mores inspired in elder days by the god Corellon, eladrin treat life and all its aspects as an art. Everything they do, wonderful or wicked, reflects this ideal.
	Like their counterparts in the world, eladrin have had to fight and die to defend their way of life. Each eladrin learns to wield the longsword, the traditional weapon of the eladrin people. They have martial disciplines that teach an eladrin to channel the innate magic in his or her spirit, as well as that stored within the elements.
	A blade from the Feywild or crafted by eladrin hands has a special beauty. The metal vibrates with bizarre potential. Some eladrin learn to make steel shaped into such a blade sing its heart's song. That song is a fey cry that portends loss of life, and those who wield it are known across the cosmos as blade banshees.
	Over the years, you've developed a terrifying synergy with your blades. You understand the secret heart of fey-crafted steel. Its unmistakable, dread voice announces your displeasure. As you fight, your blades buzz and keen, unleashing rending vibrations against your foes. But when your soul is bent to friendship or mercy, your swords hum with your own gentleness, briefly bringing a bit of peace to others before shrieking into battle once again.

The first avalanche hurlers were dwarf slaves in the ancient realms of the giants. Tempered by suffering and endless labor, and without access to soldierly methods, these dwarves tailored their ways of fighting to their work tools. They developed martial techniques that allowed them to be flexible in combat. A rebel needs ranged capability to kill in ambushes and slay retreating adversaries. Skill in melee is required to stand up to larger and quicker foes.
	Revolutionary dwarves took up their hammers and axes. They threw these tools into the faces of their oppressors. Then, hammering and hewing from underfoot, the first avalanche hurlers brought their outsized masters down and escaped to the wilderness. They settled in underground halls they cut for themselves, places too small for their enemies to invade. Dwarves then made war on giants in Moradin's name. 
	Dwarf clans have maintained the avalanche hurler fighting style across the generations. They preserve their earliest original combat style, but they never held it so sacred that they failed to give it to allies among all sorts of folk. Further, the avalanche hurler might have been originally recorded in dwarven folklore, but other races developed similar military methods independently.
	As an ever resourceful avalanche hurler, you are effective both in close combat and at range. Rather than mastering one ranger fighting style, you embrace both, using thrown melee weapons as your chosen instruments of death. What you lose in range and damage, you make up for with your versatility, being able to make attacks against adjacent enemies and then send your weapons flying against those beyond your reach.

Nerath was a just nation, it is said, but it would be a lie to say that it was built solely through negotiation, the  spread of knowledge, and cultural influence. No, as any historian can tell you, Nerath rose on the splintered shields and shattered blades of its soldiers. When an object of conquest doesn't bend, it must be made to bow.
	That was the job of Nerath's legions. Those armies consisted primarily of highly trained heavy infantry supplemented by heavy cavalry—the famed knight protectors. Nerath's military traditions were derived from older sources. In what any dragonborn would claim to be fine dragonborn style, a special auxiliary force of devastating light infantry led many of Nerath's assaults. These were the empire's shock troopers. Military historians liken them to similar troops among other cultures and peoples, especially elves and dragonborn.
	The typical shock trooper wore chainmail over leather, and carried a longsword and short sword, or dual short swords. The trooper was trained to break the line of an enemy force, moving quickly to kill and wound as many enemy soldiers as possible. If a trooper broke through the enemy line, the job then became direct assault on enemy command positions.
	Although Nerath no longer exists as an empire, more than a few of its traditions linger. Numerous fighters and schools of soldiery carry on shock trooper traditions. This is to say nothing of the similar soldiers among other peoples, such as dwarf assault fighters. Any warrior who wants training in this brutal and mobile assault style can readily find it.
	You are part of this sudden strike tradition of fighting. Unlike those warriors who form battle lines, you move among your enemies, defying them to strike you down and forcing them to pursue you. Your daring onslaughts confuse and astonish your adversaries. Even so, your guard is never down, especially in your favorite place: the center of a throng of foes.

The versatile polearm is easier to manufacture than a sword, and often easier to use effectively. In its simplest form, the polearm is a longspear—a short blade on the end of a long shaft. Since reach is an advantage, even the humble longspear is an effective weapon in unpracticed hands. In the hands of a master, its deadliness can be unparalleled.
	More complex polearms offer even greater rewards on the battlefield and off. They combine the best aspects of spear and blade or axe, allowing the user control and damage unmatched by other weapons. It's little wonder that whole units of soldiers use polearms in war, and that city watches use these weapons to protect citizens, as well as keep them in line. Because polearms are so common and easily crafted, learning to use one is part of most basic military instruction. Advanced skill isn't so easy to obtain, but the trials of regular combat serve as well as, if not better than, the training ground. The ability to use a polearm against a variety of foes can seldom be learned through the rigors of soldierly education.
	Through your adventures, you have mastered the polearm. You prefer a weapon that extends your options and your reach, understanding that it's better to keep monsters at a distance. With such a weapon at your disposal, you not only deal wounding blows to your adversaries and cut wide arcs through multiple foes, you also better protect your allies by commanding more of your surroundings.

In this age of darkness, covered by the shadow of fallen empires, never has there been a greater need for those who champion the causes of the innocent. Not since the fall of Nerath has a coherent force of warriors been guided by honor and justice in all that they do. Bold knights who fought for King Elidyr of Nerath are long lost, and the honor code to which they adhered is a curiosity of history to most. However, some see the need for such nobility today, and they try to live up to the standards set by righteous soldiers long dead. These modern fighters name themselves the knight protectors.
	Some of those who call themselves knights could equal Nerath's storied fighters in might and zeal. Without a code, though, who can say with certainty if the new knights can match bygone honor? Without a fellowship, how can like-minded individuals work toward similar ends and police their own? Indeed, a number of those who claim to be knights—and even a few who call themselves knight protectors—are anything but counterparts to the admirable warriors of old. Far too many use their self-claimed title for profligate or brutal gain.
	A loose confederation of knight protectors acts as an organization for those who claim this path. Its members are pledged to look out for one another and to keep the principles of the order. Courage, industriousness, respect, courtesy, and the glory of battle are all guiding principles. Those who fail to uphold these standards quickly find themselves at odds with other knight protectors.
	Taking up the sword and cloak of a knight protector, you see it as your task to emulate the knights of old. A warrior and something of a leader, you abide by the knight protector code for personal glory and out of respect for the past. In life, you strive to be noble, honest, and fair. When you and your comrades come under attack, you are at the forefront, testing and displaying your courage. Even if smaller minds mock you as an idealist, you know you fight with dignity and purpose.

Dragonborn issue from the same spiritual line as mighty dragons. Since the earliest days, dragonborn have nurtured their raw fury into a fighting spirit and a proud martial tradition. The empire of Arkhosia formed from these roots, and it expanded at times based as much on the power of its military force as on its civilizing influence. 
	In Arkhosia, dragonborn served dragons in numerous capacities, from vizier to archmage, oracle to valet. The most important roles performed by dragonborn, however, were as agents in a dangerous world or as defenders of the homeland. Soldierly ways passed through the generations, as did the ability to tap one's inner draconic nature.
	Particular dragonborn masters hone body, mind, and spirit through martial practice to perfectly tap into the inner dragon. Some come to this knowledge on their own; others gain it from teachers eager to train younger dragonborn in ancient traditions. Only a few master the techniques well enough to become legendary heroes or villains.
	Whatever your personal history, the untamed blood of dragons flows in your veins. Your veneration of your warrior ancestors has manifested as a supernatural tie to this heritage. You hear the call of the dragon within. Its ferocity courses through you. Woe to those who harm you, for the shedding of your blood rouses the ire of your draconic heart.

The world is wide and wild, and the nomadic halflings are small folk. Deftness and quick wits have allowed them to survive nonetheless. As they have done so, they have come to rely on wily and daring warriors to protect them. Even settled halflings maintain a soldierly class to see to their interests among other, and larger, civilized folk.
	The fighting tradition of the halfling bounder favors halfling traits. Bounders are practiced in hit-and-run strategies and pack tactics. They spring about the battlefield, avoiding the attacks of their bigger enemies, striking from unexpected angles, and making harrying assaults. Bounders willingly lay down their lives to allow those they care for to survive and escape danger.
	Most wandering halfling clans have a number of bounders who serve as scouts. These warriors help keep the traveling band carefree—they put down dangers before the threat becomes dire. Able and willing halflings can easily learn the techniques of the bounder. More than a few put this expertise to use outside halfling communities, satisfying their natural curiosity while protecting friends and common folk.
	You are one such champion of the halfling people. A flashing blade in hand, you leap about, laughing as bumbling, oversized fools trip over themselves trying to stop you. You've learned to use your small size to see the battle from a different angle, enabling you to easily spot openings others miss, hounding your enemies and taking every advantage the battle offers. If your skill comes up short for some reason, your luck more than makes up for it.

Countless fighting styles issue from dedicated masters—unimpeachable figures who devote their lives to perfecting combat maneuvers that are carried onto the battlefield by their disciples. But not all techniques evolve from the teachings of these paragons of the warrior's art. Some methods come from origins far less noble. The path of the dread reaper is one such shadowy road.
	According to legend, the first dread reaper was Gulkanon, a human paladin of the Raven Queen, stripped of his station and power for offending his god. Even without the connection to the deity he had long revered, Gulkanon was unwilling to surrender his place as her champion. He turned to a new avenue of military study, building upon the techniques of savage and fell races in the world—orcs, goblins, ogres, and trolls. He took the crude strokes of these brutish creatures and refined them, developing a range of exploits that focused his strength into a vehicle of appalling carnage. As he grew more confident in his newfound skills, he took the title “dread reaper.” He set out to send souls to his estranged patron in hopes of rekindling the bond that had been broken. Whether he succeeded is lost to time, but his legacy remains.
	Some dread reapers serve the Raven Queen, and small cults of such warriors can be found who are willing to train promising candidates. Others who have this training, however, lack the will or discipline to find true favor with the god. A few stretch her tenets to accommodate their own excesses. The Raven Queen's vigilant servants have been known to hunt and slay the worst of those offenders.
	Whether you had an affinity for death-dealing or found inspiration in the actions of another, you turned to the techniques of the dread reaper. The training offers you a special array of fighting maneuvers that emphasize your already impressive proficiency with two-handed weapons. Your training transformed you from a competent warrior to a terrifying force of destruction. Rather than minding your defenses, you favor wreaking havoc in combat. Enemies can't help but notice your destructive potential and ignore you at their peril. You can perform astonishing attacks, sweeping through your foes and laying them open with your steel.

World-shaking battles were fought between the tieflings of Bael Turath and the dragonborn of Arkhosia. The deeds and exploits of those conflicts resound still in epic story and song. One such anthem is Lament of the Dreadnought, a somber song that recounts the final march of Jagannash the Unstoppable, a great dragonborn hero.
	A doughty warrior famed for his ability to fight on no matter the injuries he sustained, Jagannash accumulated a number of legends. He withstood the full fury of an angry blue dragon, shrugged off the lashes of a pit fiend's whip, and even killed a tiefling warlock who had hurled him through Hell. The Lament, though, speaks of his final battle and all he achieved in the last offensive against the tiefling empire. Jagan nash felled a full legion of devils, strangled their succubus sorceress commander with his bare hands, and hammered his way through the walls of a fortress. He was climbing the tower that housed the tiefling war room when the earth rebelled and swallowed the citadel and all within it. It is whispered that Jagannash fights there still, despite the centuries. Such is his resilience.
	It is from Jagannash's example that other fighters who follow a similar creed take inspiration. The mind– body practices of these warriors are kept and taught by a few masters, dragonborn and otherwise. Some even develop these talents without formal training. 
	As a dreadnought, you are an inexorable force of destruction. You turn aside weapons with nothing more than your force of will. Fire cannot touch you; lightning cannot blind you. The core of your might grows from your ability to detach your mind from your body, to disassociate yourself from the pain of your wounds and press onward to keep fighting when others would succumb. You attain this state through discipline and a commitment. All who attempt to stand against you are bound to fall.

Beyond a few safe havens, the world is an unforgiving land filled with cruelty, terror, and profound evil. The blameless are slaughtered and the works of civilization are torn down, sometimes in a bid for conquest, but just as often out of sheer brutality. Destructive monsters regularly leave behind survivors, and a few of these take up the sword or the axe. These brave souls seek not to put past wrongs right, but to prevent others from suffering as they have, and to slake a thirst for vengeance. In this way, heroism is often forged in darkness.
	At some point in your life, your course was set, your path laid before you. Maybe your career as a grim hero began the moment you or those close to you fell victim to a fate you were powerless to prevent—your life forever changed by one act of depravity. Perhaps instead, as you have adventured, you've witnessed too many appalling acts, seen too many innocents buried, or found wickedness in too many shadows. Whatever the case, you now see yourself as the only one who can stand between the helpless few and the predatory hordes. You know no respite exists for those who would protect the weak. Even so, you willingly take on that task.
	As an avenging slayer, your brutal efficiency makes you a menacing figure no enemy can safely ignore. You strike fear into your enemies to protect your allies and those who have less power than you. You punish corruption with merciless retribution, defining yourself as a righteous executioner.

You studied the limitless abysses and the bright points of enigmatic light that hang between them. You listened
to the baffling disordered sounds that emerged from the simple astronomical lenses you used for your study. You learned the stars were not the innocent lamps above the world that most assumed. Despite this unsettling knowledge, you continued your study, eventually narrowing your concentration to just one star—a star named Caiphon. That's when the dreams began.
	You dreamed of a fitful star of purple fire. You walked in its light to the edge of a slime-lined pit that pulsed and heaved like a living maw, eager to consume. You hurled yourself into the cavity as the purple star flared. You fell into an amoebic sea, where you were digested over the course of a thousand years, or perhaps just one night.
	When you woke, your eyes were opalescent purple orbs, and Caiphon began whispering—whispering—into your ear. Even though you could hear only the merest fragments of Caiphon's never-ending instructions and insights, a knowing smile stitched itself across your face.

For ages your folk fought against the mighty dragon lords of Abeir. Although the catastrophe of the Spellplague broke the power of the draconic tyranny in some lands, others still suffer under the cruel talons and fell magic of dragonkind, both in Faerûn and Returned Abeir. You have vowed to free all those still enslaved by dragons, and to vigilantly defend free lands from the great wyrms.
	Steelsky liberators draw upon the power of an ancient divine blessing granted to the mortals who suffered under dragons long ago. No one knows what god or being created this blessing, but over time it has grown stronger and stronger. Each mortal soul that suffers under draconic oppression lends the weight of its sorrow and outrage to this mystic force; the harder the Abeiran dragon lords tried to eradicate the liberators, the stronger they made their enemies.
	Most steelsky liberators hail from Returned Abeir, since the oppression of ages of draconic rule still weighs heavily on those lands. However, some of these crusaders were among the dragonborn and genasi of Akanûl, Tymanther, and other lands transferred into Faerûn during the Spellplague. In the decades since, heroes from lands threatened by dragons have come to these Abeiran kingdoms to learn the secrets of defeating such powerful foes.

You follow the sometimes radiant and sometimes shadowy path of the mistress of the skies, Selûne. Through the world's many changes, one story remains eternal: Selûne's vigilant opposition to the machinations of her dark sister, Shar. Silverstars carry the light and hope of their goddess into the darkness, championing causes others think lost. 
	Unlike many of the other gods and goddesses, Selûne is willing to share some of her power with worshipers who are not solely devoted to studying her will. Wizards, warlocks, bards, and sorcerers can become silverstars of note.
	Before the Spellplague, Selûne's mortal concerns often centered on lycanthropes: werewolves, wereboars, werebears and other worshipers who could change into animal shapes governed by the moon. After the  Spellplague, lycanthropy spiraled beyond Selûne's benevolent control. She does what she can for its victims, but sometimes all she can do is offer a swift silver blade.

You are a champion of Sune, goddess of love and beauty. You delight in art, music, dance, poetry, and all other pursuits that lend beauty to mortal lives. Romance is certainly at the forefront of these, but you are no simple hedonist—to you, a courtship marked by chivalry and gallant gestures is the highest expression of true love.
	You oppose cruelty, callousness, and tyranny in all their forms. Evil creatures often seek to hoard or destroy things of beauty, and hold no love in their hearts. You seek to protect love wherever it exists and set right any wrongs that interfere with love's intended course. Daring quests and long-nurtured hopes stir your heart, especially those that lead to the flowering of beauty in a place where evil once held sway. Although you do not take pleasure in combat, sometimes evil can be checked by no other means. Through your devotion and loyalty to your companions, Sune's divine love shields them from harm and lends courage to their hearts.
	Heartwarders are most often wandering knights, poets, and gallants who roam Faerûn's cities and courts. Most can't resist a little matchmaking, and gladly advise young suitors in the arts of romance.

All warlocks make dangerous bargains with powers far beyond mortal understanding. Most do so cautiously, closing off portions of their soul to whatever fell entity they made a pact with. They fear what they might become if they get too close. They fear they might become you.
	Few are willing to grapple with dark forces as closely as you are, to look the deranged visages of unholy entities squarely in the eye. You are strong enough to control the darkness inside you. You wager your very soul daily, risking utter damnation in exchange for a dark reward. Your body is but a fetter now, anchoring you to a world that no longer seems to be yours. You walk toward a darker place now, a few steps farther every day, leaving the light at your back.
	You stand between worlds, a wraithlike shadow who wrestles with greater evil than most will ever know. The dark forces within you cry out for your soul, and so far you've denied them, harnessing their unearthly power for your own purposes, but every day it grows harder to step back into the light.

The Wolves are ferocious and dedicated to the last, but a few among them, whether through experience, a talent for command, or simply survival in the face of impossible odds, grow into undisputed masters of the Pack. These leaders, who look to Maldeen's shining example and aspire to pure excellence in command, are always warlords who combine their mastery of tactics with a hatred of all things evil to great effect. The Pack Masters of Maldeen are shining beacons of virtue, inspiring their allies in the fight through the darkest hours of the Pack's struggle. Bane to corruption, evil, and temptation, the Pack Masters are elite among the Wolves. Their tireless devotion to the struggle of light against darkness serves as a lesson to aspirant candidates for membership in the Wolves, and as a fearsome warning against any who might choose a darker path in search of power.

Storied history follows the shield, a warrior's best friend and an implement of honor and identity in a fighter's panoply. A stout shield can turn aside mundane swords and arrows, as well as monstrous venom sprays and dragon fire. Only a steadfast ally is better for covering the flank while you're taking it to the enemy. Nothing is better to protect that ally.
	Throughout time, the use of the shield has defined military tactics. In phalanx formations, common among many folk, one soldier stands alongside another, each relying on a comrade's shield for added protection. During a charge, a shield aids in pushing the enemy back or even down. Warriors in a unit of skilled shield bearers can place their shields together in an overarching arrangement, completely protecting all within the shield shell from outside attack. This is said to have originally been a dwarven trick, a “boulder formation.”
	The Arkhosian warrior-philosopher Khomagar said, “The shield is the law of the battlefield, protecting the soldier as lordly and righteous edicts protect the empire.” Phalanx fighters from many cultures suffer dishonor or worse for losing their shields in battle, since such a loss weakens the unit as a whole. Numerous peoples maintain a tradition of bringing dead warriors home on their shields, and burying a shield with its owner. Especially among dwarves, a broken shield is seen as a symbol of loss or corruption.
	The shield is even more important to a small-unit fighter who relies upon it to protect his or her few allies. To the wise soldier who fulfills such duties, a shield is as much a weapon as a defensive item.
	You know these facts well. Through your countless skirmishes, you have mastered the use of your one-handed weapon and shield. Such is your skill that those who pay too much attention to one of your armaments inevitably suffer punishment from the other.

The spear and its cousins have existed almost as long as creation. It was the first weapon ever made, and it and its variants are still the most common arms in use. Simple spears are designed heavy for melee or light for throwing. A melee spear can be used with one hand or two. Specialized variations of the spear such as the longspear, the tratnyr, and various polearms were specifically designed for war. Such weapons provide a huge boon in the form of reach, allowing a wielder to strike from 
relative safety and to control the melee. Others, the tratnyr in particular, are multipurpose.
	Spears are the perfect weapon choice for smallunit commanders who like flexibility. Javelins and other thrown spears enable their wielders to loose volleys at a closing enemy, or make a viable option against a foe that prefers to stay at a distance. With a single spear, a warrior can choose to fight with a shield or without. Longspears and polearms allow an officer to contribute to combat while leading frombehind the front line, where the clash can be better observed and directed.
	Cognizant of the benefits of the spear, you chose to specialize in this multifaceted weapon. You trained to make long lunges and quick jabs with your weapon. A spear's haft is a defensive tool for you, and you have learned how to hedge in your foes or open deep wounds. Your skill is a blessing to your allies, who have seen that your mastery makes you a more reliable leader.

The mixing of devils and mortals created the tieflings, infusing them forever with tainted fiendish blood. But in that corruption is power. Like any power, it can be tapped for good or ill.
	Long have tieflings used the devilish energy burning in their spirits. In its most basic form, this infernal might allows the tiefling to channel anger and a desire for vengeance into attacks more vehement than normal. In ages past, however, tiefling warriors learned to channel their negative emotions into tools for war.
	Fallen Bael Turath had whole cadres of mighty fighters who could funnel fiendish fury into their military maneuvers. Despite the loss of the empire, some of these devilish fighters survived. Their fighting customs were passed on, lasting through the centuries. Today, a few tiefling soldiers offer training that allows would-be warfiends to control the devil inside. Others, who must do without such guidance, find that the inner fiend is best directed into violence lest it pollute other aspects of life.
	So many of your kind fear the taint lurking in their soul, but you realize it is merely a tool at your disposal. Without needing to embrace evil, you nurtured your infernal aspect and mastered it. You've coupled deadly skill at arms with the dread power of your heritage, helping you to defend your allies and to make your foes pay for daring to stand against you. Now the corruption within you serves your aims, coating your weapon in baleful fire and allowing you to consume the fleeting energy of dying foes.

Your people defied the titans and giants. Unity has sustained them, and tenaciousness has upheld them; traditions preserving these values serve them well. They stand unmoved and unconquered, like the mountains, against orcs and goblins and dragons.
	Dwarf soldiers are unmatched in their fighting prowess and loyalty to one another. War stories hold that a single dwarf foot soldier is the match of any two warriors of another race and the same skill. Two such soldiers are worth five similarly skilled enemies. When the enemy forces are composed of little more than savages, dwarven armies break them like stone channels water.
	All the institutions of dwarven society have soldiers loyal to the cause. Doughty fighters serve king or lord, guild or business, deity or church, or a simple creed. A few serve the almighty coin, selling their time and axes for wealth. Time-honored fighting techniques teach a dwarf warrior to use his or her racial abilities to the fullest and to use fine weapons and heavy armor. When the dogs of war are loosed, dwarf soldiers hold the line.
	You are a master of dwarven fighting arts, relying on loyal allies as much as your own courage and resilience. Your expertise lies in defensive maneuvers and battle-line tactics. You know how to take advantage of holes in enemy lines. Allies come to rely on you as the center of the squad. They take heart in your steadfastness and your ability to break the defenses of your enemies.

Supernatural might comes naturally to a tiefling. Blood tied to the dark history of devils makes the reason for this obvious. In a vestigial form, this power lends vehemence to a tiefling's retaliation against attackers. History has shown that a tiefling who wishes to do so can reach inward for even more power, manifesting it in a variety of ways.
	Those ways are mirrored in devils and their home. When mortals speak of the Nine Hells, they refer to fire, smoke, and the burning wrath of fiends. But the truth is more complex. The hells have ice, storms, and shadow. They even have combinations of these, the elements mixing in strange and unnatural ways to produce oddities such as lightless fire.
	Some tieflings prefer to live up to expectations, displaying talent with anger and flame. They evoke terror by playing the devil's part. But they lack subtlet y, which is a devil's best tool. They fail to acknowledge that mortals most fear what they can't see.
	Drawing on the darkness within, a darkness that extends from the hells, a tiefling can gain uncanny advantages against enemies. Eyes can be dimmed, darkness and invisibility can be pierced, and flesh can be burned without light.
	You know this, because you have learned to summon the darkness enshrouding your soul. By coupling it with your deadly martial skills, you become a terror in lightless halls under the earth, as well as on shadowed streets and in moonless wilds. Where light does find you, you snuff it in the sight of your foes. Eventually, the shadows you call up will be able to, at times, burn your enemies like extraplanar blackfire.

Halflings have a long tradition of using light blades with great skill. Whether a tool of survival or an implement of battle, the simple dagger has much to recommend it. Even one as small as a halfling can hide a dagger on the body for use in a tight spot.A small body coupled with a small weapon means greater  mobility and deadliness enhanced by a better chance for stealthy attacks.
	Halflings also have a history of using light blades in their art and performances. Carving, acrobatic blade tricks, knife juggling, dagger throwing, and even dances that incorporate blades are common among halflings. For them, such activities are a natural meeting of physical traits and handy tools.
	As with almost every other aspect of their life, halflings have a variety of stories that explain their propensity for using blades. Such yarns include the daring tales of Barras Quickblade, whose surname is probably one of convenient fiction.
	Barras's legend begins when he was a lad who provided for his clan by stalking game with nothing but a knife and his wits. The legend grows into a spirited saga of an adventurous halfling who, along with a band of other intrepid characters, confronts ogres, yuan-ti, and worse with a tongue as pointed as his blade.
	In the end, most stories have it that Barras sacrificed himself to save his comrades by leading a group of fomorians on a reckless chase through the Feywild. Darker versions say that Barras's spirit is still trapped, kept prisoner by the twisted fey. Halflings prefer to think that he passed from the world and that he stands at Avandra's side as her immortal companion.
	You have the flair and the growing reputation to be a quickblade. Your fighting style is like that of your celebrated forebear. Perhaps, given time, your legend will be even greater.

Whoever says crime doesn't pay just isn't good enough to pull it off. For the organized and resourceful, there's always an angle.
	Thieves' guilds are criminal gangs that crop up mostly in urban areas. A single guild might manage or influence illegal activities such as assassination, blackmail, burglary, espionage, fencing stolen goods, grifting, smuggling, loan sharking, pickpocketing, piracy, racketeering, robbery, thuggery, and so on. A guild might also direct legal enterprises as legitimate business ventures, as cover, or as a way to control the flow of information. For instance, many thieves' guilds have their fingers in begging, bounty hunting, mercenary work, gambling, prostitution, shipping, and even street cleaning and lamp lighting.
	Because a guild's business can be so varied, and because it often has trouble with legal authorities and rival gangs, it must divide its profitable interests between various centers of control. Those centers have bosses, who report to those higher in the chain of command. Thus, guilds have complicated hierarchies, clear divisions of authority, and codes of behavior that can border on downright law-abiding in some respects. A guildmaster typically leads a portion of a guild, and some guilds have a grand master who oversees a guild's entire operation.
	You might be an actual guildmaster, or maybe you grew up in the criminal world and know what's what on the street and in a brawl. Your experience has left you able to run a criminal crew on jobs and in fights. You're a great skirmisher who knows how to get a job done right while helping out your pals with some “world-wise management.”

The transition to death is a holy road on which all living things are pilgrims. Every creature steps onto that road at birth. When fate's appointed hour comes, every creature steps off into whatever waits beyond the finite and visible path. So it has been, and so it should be. These are the truths of the Raven Queen.
	Yet some do not hold to the proper path. Brazen mortals defy the natural order by avoiding that righteous hour of ending. A few do so by magic or other means, the most common of which is to become undead.
	Undead aren't, in and of themselves, offensive to the Raven Queen. Still, shambling dead brought back to a mockery of life through foul magic deserve to be destroyed. So do those undead that defy true death by serving other entities, such as Orcus or Vecna. A few bold souls manage to elude death without otherwise blaspheming the Raven Queen's edicts. Still, demise must come for them in time as well.
	It is the duty of any who serve the Raven Queen to bring down the proud, showing them the equality that only death provides. Within temples where the Raven Queen is esteemed above all others, the clergy offers support and training for those who would be her instruments of death. Cults form around the ideal of righteous killing, of becoming heralds of death. Common folk know of the Raven Queen's heralds and whisper of their mission when sudden loss of life visits the prideful, the wicked, or those cursed by undeath.
	You have consciously devoted yourself to becoming a tool in the Raven Queen's wintry hands. Perhaps you came to this commitment on your own, or maybe you have an affiliation with the Raven Queen's hierarchy in the world. The origin of your connection to the mistress of winter makes little difference. As a harbinger of destiny, you know that every foe who falls before you has met its appropriate end.

Survival in the bloody frontier lands follows a savage code without the niceties of honorable engagement. Your experiences in the world's darker conflicts have pushed you to a pragmatism that other warriors may lack—react fast, or die. If you can strike first, you will. If you miss, you aim your blows to push your enemies into your allies' blades. And when your allies find a way to strike your enemies by surprise, you anticipate and aid their actions. 
	Some might say that your methods are haphazard and desperate. They may be right, but as far as you can tell, desperate efforts are exactly what's required.

In the years following the Spellplague, Lathander, the eternally young god of new beginnings and hope, transfigured into his ancient incarnation Amaunator. Although Amaunator dropped the youthful mask he had worn for centuries, his experiences as the Dawn Lord shook him from his ancient mindset. Amaunator is still a dignified god of immense age, but he remembers his youth, and he encourages his followers to do the same.
	As a Morninglord, you are the champion of your god's youth. The optimistic spirit of Lathander guides you as you seek to master the chaos of the new world. The fires of your god burn within you and lend you the inexhaustible energy of youth. You are tireless, fierce, rebellious and full of hope. You shine like a beacon in the darkest hours of night, inspiring those around you to greatness they never dreamed possible.
	To your enemies you are the searing sun itself, shedding scorching brilliance from your form. Evil is confronted by fiery annihilation in your wake, for though you walk with Lathander's carefree spirit, your heart burns with the all-consuming fire of Amaunator.

The beacon that is Evermeet shines gloriously bright, even in the darkest of hours. You have tempered your warlock pact by communion with the ancient powers that dwell in the forests of the eladrin home island. The
spirits of Evermeet have the most to offer to warlocks who are already bound to other fey (those of the fey pact), but any warlock, regardless of his or her pact, can discover advantages of allying with Evermeet's pact-makers.
	The almost-forgotten, gossamer spirits of Evermeet offer great boons to those who call upon their secret names, which have not been uttered by mortal lips for millennia. The fey of Evermeet move freely to  and from the Feywild. With their aid you can wield powers that mere mortals were not meant to wield.
	You are a light against the blackness, a beacon of hope in the coldest depths of night.

During the long years of her rule, the mysterious Simbul—Witch Queen of Aglarond—took on many apprentices and schooled them in her secrets of power. Although she no longer rules in Aglarond, the apprentices of her apprentices form an elite cadre of spellcasters known as the simbarchs. They keep alive many of the Simbul's arts and take on new apprentices of their own. You have studied with mages who in turn studied with the Simbul herself.
	Although the ruling council of Aglarond is made up of simbarchs, a few of the Simbul's magical “descendants” are not members of the council and prefer to practice their magic privately. You fall into this group. As a simbarch, you have the right to claim a seat on the council, but doing so entails assuming many serious responsibilities, and there are political considerations. If you decide to join the council, it can take months or even years before you are formally recognized.
	Whether or not you join the leaders of Aglarond, you wield your magic with a wild abandon that terrifies your enemies. Your arcane power sustains and strengthens you, granting you seemingly superhuman reserves of vitality and health. You practice compassion and restraint, but when the time comes for wrath, you are a terrible enemy indeed.

Silverymoon's mythal was nearly the equal of that which protected Myth Drannor. Unlike Myth Drannor's magical  shield, Silverymoon's mythal weakened and eventually fell during the Spellplague. The city's survival and continued prosperity owes much to the efforts of the Spellguard, Silverymoon's coalition of arcane protectors.
	The Spellguard guards Silverymoon vigilantly, hunting threats to the city, defying death, and intercepting mortal foes before they reach the heart of Luruar. Considerable latitude exists for adventurous members of the Spellguard to operate beyond the city limits, so long as they comport themselves as effective representatives of Silverymoon.
	All arcane heroes are welcome in the Spellguard's ranks. Warlocks, swordmages, and others serve with distinction, but as a wizard your arcane power is the heart and soul of the organization. Just as in the days of Mystra, the wizards of today serve as offensive weapons in defense of their beloved city. The shield might be broken, but it is not forgotten, and the vestiges of its power are yours to command against the enemies of Silverymoon.

You live only to serve the Crown of Cormyr and defend its people from the menacing evils of the world. Cormyr's  armies are thick with pikes and blades, but you are among the finest in the nation's mighty military machine. Evil is everywhere, preying on those who cannot defend themselves, but you are the sword and shield that stand for justice.
	As a knight of Cormyr, your honor is everything. You do not bend it, for to do so would sully the memory of your fallen comrades. You do not compromise with evil, nor can you ignore it as so many people do every day. Your oath is to combat iniquity, avarice, and wickedness wherever they rear their ugly heads. Wherever cruelty and sin fester, wherever corruption takes hold, and wherever enemies of your great kingdom thrive is where you are needed most.
	Your training is second to none, and your fierce determination has seen you through death's door and back again on more than one occasion. You cultivate martial prowess that far exceeds that of your foes, but this is not your greatest strength. Your most impressive skill is as a commander on the battlefield. You are an anointed knight, and a born leader whose presence inspires those who share your worthy cause.

Evil festers everywhere, and the earth needs defenders to keep back the tide of corruption. You are the shield against the onslaught, the hammer that breaks the tyrant's blade, the axe that sunders the slave's shackles, and the fist that crushes evil wherever it shows its vile face. For the source of your power, you look to the stone beneath your feet. You draw upon its sacred power to scatter your foes, and throw off the pain of a hundred wounds.
	Implacable as the earth itself, you cannot be broken. A boulder might be sundered, but it cannot be destroyed, and even if it is ground to sand it has merely traded the one for the many. You and your allies are all hewn from the same rock. You are one, even if you are many, and their life is your own. You never allow another to harm an ally unanswered, and you would gladly give yourself to death to keep a friend from danger.
	The power of stone is in your heart, allowing you to fight harder than any foe could ever anticipate and stay standing long after lesser heroes would have fallen. With your feet firmly on the ground you cannot be bested. All who tread upon the sacred stones of this world best do so lightly, for if they sully the earth with evil, you'll find them and make them pay.

The Underdark is a terror to most surface folk. Flesheating fungi carpet the walls, bizarre monstrosities lurk in the dark, and whole civilizations of evil flourish in the sunless depths. To you, this is home. You know the twisting tunnels of the Underdark intimately. Every bend in every cavern and every corner in every dungeon is your ally, allowing you to creep close to your foe. You are the hunter in the dark, and you strike from the shadows before your foe ever senses danger.
	You have little use for the rest of your kind. While you test your skill in the wilds of the dark, other drow wallow in decadence and cruelty in their cities. You've honed the magical abilities of your heritage with long practice, and now the power that flows through your blood is far greater than theirs. You walk the darkness free, while they remain ensorcelled in Lolth's slavish snares.
	Life is a journey. You live to see what wonders and heart-pounding adventures await you just out of sight. The darkness is an unforgiving mistress, but you know her all too well. Choose your path across or beneath Faerûn. No one can stop you.

Impiltur is a land under siege. Once it was a thriving bastion of civilization looked up to by the surrounding kingdoms, its coffers full of gold and the sparkle of priceless gems. Now demons haunt its wilds, and every day more plaguechanged and spellscarred nightmares emerge from the Earthspur Mountains.
	As a demon slayer, you fearlessly hunt the foul abominations prowling your homeland. Demons are the stuff of most adventurers' nightmares, but your training and fierce devotion to their destruction grants you the power to lay low these otherworldly horrors. You hunt demons as lesser rangers hunt wolves or bears, running these revolting monstrosities to ground and cutting them to pieces. Your death-dealing abilities even grant your allies the power to circumvent a demon's prodigious defenses. Your twin blades are the bane of demons, cutting a swath through their foul legions and purging their dark influence from your once-great kingdom.

Though all swordmages are students of both arcane arts and combat, you take this diversity of interest to its  ultimate expression. Strict adherence to a single style or formal school of combat doesn't interest you. Instead, you build an eclectic fighting style from techniques gathered from far corners of every land. Spells
created by masters whose styles don't fit into normal swordmage schools are your best weapons.
	Your knowledge spans a great number of topics. You could know tales of ancient Cormanthyr, recent events in the Moonshaes, and legends about brave dragonslayers who lived in Abeir long before it returned. You can learn something new from anyone you talk to. Even conflicting views of the same event show you how peoples' biases can affect their awareness—a weakness you can exploit when fighting. The folklore of each region carries lessons that any warrior can use. In every fable, bit of trivia, or snippet of news, you learn a philosophical lesson that guides you in battle.

You have studied the ways of the anarchs of Shyr, an order of genasi swordmages who developed their arts thousands of years ago in Abeir. Students of this school harness the power of the Elemental Chaos to unleash devastation against their enemies.
	For centuries the anarchs defended the genasi realm against the draconic empires. They also served to check the power of Shyran lords when the rulers of that land veered toward tyranny. The order fell apart when the anarchs lost their way and turned to meddling and kingmaking. A handful of masters who remained true to the order's ancient purpose preserved the anarch teachings. When Abeir and Toril merged briefly during the Spellplague, anarch disciples brought this ancient tradition to Faerûn.
	In the decades since, the way of the Shyran anarchs has spread slowly across Faerûn. Schools devoted to this path can be found in Akanûl, Aglarond, Calimshan, and the Dragon Coast. The anarchs of Shyr are no longer a unified society, and no longer serve Shyr—but a few still honor the old ways.

Since the days of the Crown Wars, the eladrin have studied the swordmage's art, seeking to fuse arcane mastery  and martial skill into a single seamless style. You are a student of this exclusive tradition. Where the genasi traditions of Abeir are known for their spectacular fury and flamboyant style, you have mastered the graceful and reserved elven battle arts. You sow your arcane magic into your wardings and armor, unleashing it only when your enemy least expects you to strike.
	Several traditions of eladrin sword magic exist in Faerûn. The Coronal Guard tradition is a style perfected in the realm of Cormanthyr more than a thousand years ago. In those days, the armathors were the elite guards of Myth Drannor's coronals. Despite their skill and valor, Myth Drannor fell during the Weeping War more than seven hundred years ago, and most armathors were slain. However, a few survived to pass on their lore. With the refounding of Myth Drannor, the armathors live again as the Coronal Guard of the City of Song.
	The eladrin of Myth Drannor do not teach the armathor's art to just anyone. However, this tradition is known in other places as well—for example, Evereska, Evermeet, and Silverymoon. Even in the absence of formal instruction, skillful swordmages of other races have been known to imitate the armathor style.

Netherese swordmages are masters of shadow and steel, blending the ancient Netherese warrior arts with their  wizards' dark arcana. You have trained in the swordmage arts practiced in Netheril, and you have become one of the deadly umbriri. Your skill with a blade blends darkness, magic, and the subtle techniques of the shadowy masters into the perfect killing art.
	The Netherese do not appreciate their secrets of combat being turned against them. You are hunted by the Shadows within the shadows. They would see you dead before you pass the fell secrets of your art to outsiders. Umbriri loyal to the Netherese wizards despise you, feeling that you dishonor those who spent millennia perfecting this ancient art.
	Most umbriri are human Netherese, the descendants of those shadowborn humans who returned to Faerûn over a hundred years ago. They serve as the champions and elite guards of the city of Shade Enclave. Others are Sembians who showed promise enough to warrant instruction and were invited to train in the umbriri art. Some of these are secretly loyal to the memory of a free Sembia and hide their disloyalty from their overlords. The most powerful umbriri are ancient shade swordmasters, native-born Shadovars rewarded with transformation into deathless shadows for their skill and loyalty.

The wind is immortal. Air moves and flows around us all, it is a source of life, and yet it is capable of wreaking terrible destruction. Hurricanes and windstorms can bring a castle down around a king's ears, or hurl even the greatest hero off a cliff to rocky death below. Your race is connected to the currents of air as you are to all the elements, but for you air is not just a part of your soul; it is a source of incredible power. You are a whirlwind genasi, and your supremacy over wind is the stuff of legend.
	Flight, the ability to send your foes sprawling with gale-force wind, or the power to sweep the field of battle with a boulder-crushing, tree-splintering tornado are all as commonplace to you as a casual wave of your hand. You control the flow of a fight, using your power over air to move your foes like pawns around a chessboard.

They say a fire rages in the heart of all genasi, but if this is so, it's nothing compared to the inferno raging within you. You are the master of flame and smoke, reducing all who defy you to burnt cinders and piles of ash. Fire is a tame thing in your hands, dancing in your palm and answering to your every whim.
	Your igneous heritage grants you the power to hurl flames upon the enemy or shield your allies from the searing heat of Hell itself. You are the center of a constant whirlwind of fire, and anyone who dares attack you gets burned.
	Fire is in your life's blood, and though it destroys others, it grants you greater vitality. Pity those who must face you in combat, for they do not face a mortal foe, but rather the force of a volcano, with lava for blood and the promise of burning agony to any who raise their weapons against you.

You thrive in the time between sundown and night. The shadows of twilight are all that keep you alive. They are a shroud even the Shadovar cannot pierce, from which you strike at their foul hearts. And long before the Netherese can find you, you've returned to the twilight shroud.
	You are a silent blade in the mists, a trained killer whose skill at stealth foils even those foes who live in shadow and illusion. You are a ghost of eventide, a vengeful spirit fighting against an ancient foe whose tyranny has long laid a crushing yoke upon your race. It is only through wit, skill, and perseverance that anyone could survive against such dread foes. You repay their evil with death, and your training makes you the very best and bravest of any knife-wielding rogue or shadow warrior. You live on the knife's edge, tempting fate and inviting the wrath of some of the most powerful and vile enemies in all of Toril.

You belong to the elite order of battle mages who have laid their staffs before the Crown of Cormyr. You and your comrades are the sword and shield that protect the kingdom from the insidious sorceries of Netheril and other more subtle threats. The War Wizards work in concert with the army of Cormyr, guarding the realm from attack. In battle they march alongside the Purple Dragons, launching surgical strikes and raining lightning, frost, and fire down upon the enemy.
	As a War Wizard, you are a master spellcaster whose powers are focused not on study or the secrets of the universe, but rather on the art and artifice of battle. You would prefer a peaceful world unblemished by the forces of evil, but wishing will not make it so, and therefore each day you hone your mastery of magic to throw back the tide of darkness and achieve victory. Your powers are focused on controlling the field of battle and wreaking arcane fury upon as many enemies as possible.
	Most War Wizards are Cormyrians, but a few folk of other lands study in Cormyr's War Wizard academy and then swear fealty to the crown. A War Wizard who wants to pursue his own interests and adventure in other lands is free to do so—as long as he keeps an eye open for matters of import to the crown and never acts against the Forest Kingdom's best interests.

In the High Forest, the secrets of the deep, old woods are closely guarded, and few know of the many wild things  that walk amid the shadowed boles. Silver stags, wise hares, unicorns, butterflies the size of hawks, and tree owls that have survived a hundred winters roam through the gloom. Living, bark-wrapped pillars hold aloft layers upon layers of a mounting canopy that filters sunlight into a hundred hues of emerald and gold. But the High Forest shelters deadly danger, too. Wild forest creatures, tattooed savages, and haunted barrows are common threats that travelers face.
	But worse lies farther in. Hideously disfigured and powerful plaguechanged creatures lurk in shadowed vales, forgotten demon servitors of Netheril wake to their masters' return, and yuan-ti from Najara search for something they will not name. Many threats trouble the shadowed thickets of your home.
	These enemies do not pass unmarked. You are the ghost in the trees, the arrow on the wind, and to monstrous creatures who haunt the woods, you are swift and merciless death. The forest is your country, and you do not take kindly to uninvited guests. Neither serpentfolk nor demon can hide from your arrows.

Since the Spellplague struck, all manner of terrible abominations have spread across the face of Toril. Creatures  that have spellscars riddle the world now, sowing madness and fear wherever they appear. To a select few, though, the spellscar that mars their flesh is no curse, but rather a powerful boon. You are one of these few, a spellscarred savant. You wear your scar as a badge of power and a fell warning to your foes.
	You have learned to harness the dark gift of your spellscar and channel its disrupting power. The erratic forces behind your spellscar are yours to command now. Your mastery of your spellscar allows you to tap into the raw magical energy known as spellfire, either to heal yourself with its sizzling power or invigorate your body in combat. As your power grows, you can wield the fury of spellfire as easily as a warrior does a blade, calling down the untempered essence of magic gone mad to burn foes to ash.

The sea is an open road, and adventure calls to you from a dozen strange shores. You are always on the lookout for the next big prize or daring escapade. Whatever it might be—a lost hoard in a sea demon's cave, a legendary shipwreck haunted by drowned ghosts, the fat treasure ship of a villainous merchant lord, or a misty isle wreathed in magic and mystery— you are determined to seek it out and test your cunning and courage against any obstacle in your path. You mean to blaze a path of fame or notoriety that they'll be talking about a hundred years from now.
	Even though you prowl the seas as a reckless freebooter and fierce predator, you are not necessarily a bloody-handed murderer. You would rather steal the ill-gotten gains of others than plunder the weak and poor. The Sea of Swords is dangerous enough without making yourself the enemy of all civilized folk, after all. It's better to let honest folk pay for your protection. And if you can drive the truly murderous scum from the seas, then you'll have less competition for the prizes that do catch your eye.

A ravager is the quintessential battlerager, a savage and fearless fighter. Such a warrior thrives on rage and bloodlust, literally chewing on a shield's rim or weapon's haft to diffuse wild energy when a promised clash is too long in coming. When combat is joined, a ravager rushes headlong into the fray, leaving a trail of bleeding foes and twitching corpses behind.
	You scoff at disciplined practice, romantic devotion to a code, and effete arms such as rapiers. A dedicated killer, you rely on the force of your weapon and the rush that battle gives you. Some might describe you as an uncultured lout, but you laugh at them as well. When they cower before the horrors of the night and the wild places, you stand fast, ready to whet your weapon on your enemies.
	Being a ravager means that every skirmish is a chance for blood and glory. It's an opportunity to win fame, the favor of the gods, and maybe more than one form of immortality. You throw yourself into every fight as if it were your last, leaping fearlessly among your foes where you can wreak the most havoc. With your reckless bravery, you bring fame and honor to yourself, your people, your ancestors, and the gods who watch over you. And if the gods can't be bothered—to Hell with them too.

Perhaps the pull you feel is in your head, a delusion born from desperation. Do you dare ignore it? If the despoilers aren't stopped, what future does this world have?

Lolth's return and a resumption of the disastrous war that nearly shattered the elven peoples cast a terrible shadow across Corellon's priesthood. Anticipating this event, the elders formed the Azure Guard who would one day serve as the principle leaders in repelling Lolth's demonic forces. The warriors combine prayers to Corellon with secret arcane spells to achieve the edge they need to overcome their enemies. Azure Guard members do not advertise their special status lest they invite assassins to strike at them. One cannot join the Azure Guard without invitation, and even those called to serve in its esteemed ranks may find themselves unequal to the demands the training makes.

At 11th level, your veilwalker deva takes on the heavenly deceiver paragon path. You walk just this side of a boundary thinner than the finest veil and develop an affinity for the deceptive magic of the rakshasa even as the memories of past incarnations become distant. You choose your path to take advantage of this power and wield it against evil; or perhaps you are on a path dictated by your carelessness because the intentionally evil would already be beyond redemption. You bear patterns on your skin distinct from those on most devas. The colors are always darker and include more red than their incorruptible brethren. The patterns made by the colorations are sharper, more sudden, and more violent than the simple elegance of other devas.
    The longer you remain a veilwalker, the greater a command over illusion and deceit that balancing act grants you. Manipulation of others becomes an art and a second nature to you.

At 11th level, your redeemed deva takes on the dark star paragon path. Freeing oneself from corruption is no guarantee against returning to evil, and no one knows this better than does the fallen deva. Reclaiming your deva form does nothing to dispel those memories and experiences from your time as rakshasa. The wicked memories lurk in your thoughts, urging you to indulge in deviant acts, to embrace vice and wickedness, and to succumb to evil's temptation once more.
    Your dark memories haunt you. Try as you might, you cannot silence the voices nor can you suppress the experiences you found in your fallen state. As you were once able, you can still call upon the memories you carry to aid you, but in addition to the other deva lifetimes, you also can draw upon your time as rakshasa as well. Drawing from these recollections places you at risk of falling once more, but provided you remain fixed toward your path, perhaps one day you will overcome the shame you must shoulder.
    Devas know their redeemed brethren as dark stars, so named for their new ascendancy toward virtue and also for the evil shadowing their souls. Devas are, of course, rare in the world and so dark stars are even rarer-so scarce most might believe them representative of the entire race. As a dark star, you must ever contend with your unpleasant memories while working to earn the redemption you have received.

Ameth's closest friend and advisor, Sot-Olmat, pioneered a discipline of rigorous mastery over the elements within a genasi. It is a discipline that one can master through a combination of meditation on a simple mantra and a series of exercises that look harmless but serve to unlock elemental potential within the genasi. The mantra is a repetition in Primordial regarding one's elemental affinity: Fire cannot be chained, or Water cannot be chained. Some manifestations require the mantra be changed: Earth is not chained; earth is the chain. Acid consumes all chains. Sot-Olmat developed this path while a slave, and he continues to expose himself to danger to teach the rudiments of it to other enslaved genasi.
	A genasi who studies this discipline becomes impossible to bind or cage. He or she can escape bonds of all sorts swiftly, becoming a master of escape artistry through the mastery of the elemental nature innate to every genasi.

The desperate conditions on Athas call for desperate measures. Wielders of the Way use slivers cut from their own minds to strengthen their armaments.The exchange is worth its price, since it lets them disorient and destroy their foes. They can always reclaim the mental fragments, though some wielders of the Way consider certain emotions to be liabilities and believe life runs smoother without those feelings cluttering their minds.
	You entrust the wild, untamed parts of yourself to your weapon, mentally fracturing your personality and reinforcing your weapon—whether it's an obsidian sword, a bone axe, or a rock warhammer—with that emotion. Though you still have a faint connection to that piece of your mind (at least enough to replace it later), you do have difficulty expressing the emotion associated with that fragment. Your allies find you inscrutable, wondering how you can fight with such ferocity while keeping a placid demeanor, or why your expressions and speech seem calm while you're pursuing stronger and stronger foes.

Practitioners of the Way form connections between their minds and bodies that allow them to go beyond their physical limits. Wilders with strong inborn talents have the strongest connection, and hurting such an individual causes his or her psionic power to flare even brighter. Some wilders have returned after being exiled to the desert, walking tall when they should be nothing but piles of picked-clean bones. Others have become notorious for their battle prowess, taking on wave after wave of enemies and dispatching each more viciously than the last.
	As your foes attack, your mind surges and you feel your muscles and senses burn with new strength. With every cut and bruise you suffer, more power rushes over you, making your mind more dangerous and protecting or healing your damaged body.

The deserts of Athas are breeding grounds for raiders, brigands, and bloodthirsty savages of all kinds. In a world where it takes backbreaking labor to scratch out a living from the dusty soil and countless people live under the shadow of famine and starvation, many creatures find it easier to get what they need by taking it from others. Most sand reavers operate in small bands, since large tribes can't support themselves on the slim pickings of the deserts. Other reavers move from band to band and region to region, seeking out the easiest prey and most reliable companions they can find. Life among the marauding tribes is often brutal and short; the day a warrior fails to keep up with the march or take his next meal from the tribe's latest victim is the day he is left behind, abandoned to his fate.
	As a sand reaver, you are a wolf of the wilderness, a lean and hungry predator. You are familiar with the harsh laws of the desert bands and always ready to react to sudden violence—or begin it, if need be. You are regarded as an outlaw and an enemy to all civilized creatures, and your life is forfeit in any city-state you enter if you are identified for who and what you are. The best of your kind are outlaws with a glimmer of purpose and a rough code of honor, sworn to protect each other and to steal only from those who have goods to spare. The worst are rabid jhakars and ragged kestrekels without a single redeeming virtue. Where you fall on this scale is, of course, up to you.
	Whether you chose a life in the desert or found it forced on you, your experiences leave you changed. Your softness, mercy, and empathy are gone, and in their place is only ruthless determination. But your struggles leave you stronger, tougher, and better able to withstand any difficulty you encounter. Above all, you are a survivor, and the wastes are your home.

The endless deserts, shattered mountains, and broken landscape are home to more than just rubble and debris. Life survives despite the challenges, as proven by the desert snakes, the dune mice, the scrabbling lizards, the burgeoning cacti, and more. As the nomadic tribes well know, life might be easier in some ways in the city-states, but it's not impossible in the wastelands if you know what to look for and what to do. Yet there are greater secrets than these guarded by the land's spirits. Through long sojourns in the deserted places of the world and years of studying the land's mysteries, you have acquired the skills needed to subsist in the most barren environments. No land, no matter how desolate, poses so great a danger as to bar your passage.
	As a dune strider, you are the living embodiment of wanderlust. The dust of a dozen cities and villages lies under your sandals; from the Ringing Mountains to the Sea of Silt, from the Endless Sand Dunes to the Road of Fire, you mean to take in all the splendors of Athas in good time. You witness the world from a unique perspective, seeing its beauty as well as its desolation, believing the possibility that the wrongs done to it can one day be righted. The land's spirits offer you their power to aid in this restoration and help you to punish those who worsen the world and bring it ever closer to annihilation.

Preservers of the Veiled Alliance lead the way for spellcasters everywhere, keeping the only honorable path of arcane power alive. And yet as powerful as they are, most of them need stalwart warriors to hold back the enemy while they work their magic. Protecting preservers is a duty of all who consider themselves members of the Veiled Alliance.
	You have taken this tenet to heart and become its embodiment. Involvement with preservers has taught you much. Your training with the Alliance has honed your skills so that you can disable any adversary. This practice might have even made you into a preserver proper, if you weren't one before.
	Now you are an elite defender of the Alliance and its goals, an ideal example of the preserving way. You weave arcane power to give your allies the openings they need. So that you and your allies can succeed, you hinder the enemy with specialized techniques. Victory is sometimes defined as mere survival or a daring escape, but preventing enemies of the Alliance from doing harm or making their own getaway is even better. Few do that better than you.

For most arcane spellcasters, the urge to defile is an ever-present temptation that whispers deep in their souls. The unseen life energy of plants and animals nearby sings with power as a spell is shaped, a ripe fruit waiting to be plucked and savored. Far too many spellcasters see no reason to resist, and they eagerly rip away the life essence to fuel their magic, but those who choose the preserver's path carefully shape their spells around this fragile aura, drawing a little energy from many different places, and never so much that the life that it emanates from is harmed or extinguished.
	In this delicate give-and-take of spellcasting, the master preserver is an arcanist who has developed a perfect sense for the balance of destruction and power. Whereas other casters struggle to maintain their discipline and must consciously control their impulse to drink too deeply of the fragile energy around them, the master preserver's self-control, experience, and intuitive grasp of the subtle currents at play allow him to instantly shape his spells without fear of defiling. In fact, the master preserver's skill and precision are so great that he can often match the raw power of the most reckless defilers without harming a single blade of grass.
	When you choose the master preserver's path, you turn your back on defiling forever. From that day forward, the whispers of temptation hold no more power over you. But in exchange, your sacrifices have led you to a place where you need to give less to perform your magic; the world now gives you a little back. If this situation isn't confirmation of your path's integrity, what else could be?

The lowly and the ignorant see defilers as craven and corrupt—little more than thieves with magical talent. It's true that the defiler's path is selfish in its way: A defiler requires energy from associates and the living world nearby to power his or her greatest spells. And it is also true is that defiling can corrupt the body and mind. But only a fool could fail to see the power that defiling offers, and you are not a fool.
Most who openly defile enjoy the protection of high station or powerful patrons. Perhaps you are of noble birth, and your family's wealth protects you from the consequences of your actions. You might have been chosen for an arcane education while still young and tutored in the ways of magic by templar instructors, or perhaps you gained the king's sanction by other means—as a reward for some great service to the king or the city, through bribery, or by the manipulation of powerful nobles or senior templars exercising the king's favor. If you are not a native of a city-state, the only sanction you require is sheer power: You can defile freely if your tribe protects you, or if you are so powerful that no one dares to challenge you.
If you are one of a sorcerer-king's sanctioned defilers, you might be expected to make yourself available for special tasks or duties as needed. Such assignments are rare, however; most sorcerer-kings allow master defilers in their cities to do more or less as they wish, trusting that they won't jeopardize the city or themselves. After all, master defilers are universally loathed, and if anything ever happens to the king, even a master defiler wouldn't last a day.

Through a combination of personal talent, family connections, wealth, and loyal service to Dictator Andropinis, you have won a high office among the templars of Balic. Most praetors are magistrates, overseers of commerce, or military commanders—they lack your personal might and are simply high-ranking officials and administrators. You, however, aren't saddled with mundane duties. Instead, you are a personal representative of the dictator, vested with the power to further the interests of the state in whatever manner you deem appropriate. As a badge of your special office, you are entitled to wear a cloak or tunic with a purple stripe or border.
	As a praetor legate, you might spy on Balic's enemies, investigate corruption, look after the defense of the life-sustaining trade routes throughout the Forked Tongue, track down criminals, or search for ancient artifacts in ruined cities. You answer only to Andropinis himself . . . and if you are a true patriot, you might find that the interests of the dictator and the interests of Balic are not always one and the same.
	Balic is friendlier to trade than any other city in the Tyr Region is, and several important merchant houses are based here. Consequently, praetors find that their duties often lead them to distant villages and even other cities, watching over Balic's trade affairs. Most praetor legates are natives of Balic, but capable and trustworthy foreigners occasionally rise high in the ranks of Andropinis's templars.

The primal spirits all bear scars from the ancient conflict that led to the world's devastation. Many vanished, consumed by destructive magic. Those who remained either retreated to the few remaining havens or turned to elemental power to sustain themselves in the bitter aftermath. It is to the ravaged, the broken, and corrupted that you turn to wage your war against tyranny and right the world's course once more. You give voice to their grievances, guiding their wrath to destroy the enemy you have vowed to fight.
	You have become the ally of these twisted primal spirits, who allow you to wield not only their strength but their very essence in your crusade against the despoilers. The spirits answer your commands, lending both primal and elemental power to your attacks. Their anger lets you drive your enemies to turn on one another, while at the same time sheltering your allies from harm or infusing them with elemental strength. The spirits are vengeful, and you are that vengeance personified. The most revealing aspect to your heightened connection is the ability to bind your spirit with your enemies, so that even as your companions close, your spirit rends the soul within.

There is no greater calling than to protect the land, to shelter it from those who would exploit it for the power it contains. Your long associations with the spirit world revealed to you the fragile balance that allows life to continue despite the hardships. Only if this balance is maintained can life and the world recover, and so you make this your work, devoting your life to its protection.
	The primal spirits are not blind to your sacrifice, and they respond to your efforts by lending aid where and when they can. Whenever you choose a land to guard, the spirits emerge from the broken landscape to add their strength to your own. They slow enemies as they approach and punish the trespassers.
	As your bond with the land grows, so too does your understanding of its power. You can draw primal magic into yourself when you assume bestial forms, growing your strength and vitality. Within your guarded sites you can move from place to place, ensuring that nothing under your stewardship comes to harm. And if you face a dire threat, you can call forth the ancient spirits to harry and kill any you name as your enemy.

Psionic power has an infinite number of uses, but few people on Athas develop more than a passing familiarity with their innate talents. Within the psionic schools of the city-states, or with private tutors, noble children are expected to hone their psionic powers. As with any type of study, most students don't put forth much effort, and therefore don't learn much. The average noble retains the barest vestiges of psionic training, just enough to overhear gossip from a distance or to telekinetically move a cup a few inches.
	While your peers shirked their studies and neglected their psionic gifts, you devoured every piece of lore and technique you could. Fascinated by the capabilities of the mind, you practiced constantly and delved deep into the secrets of the Way. Every time you outmatched another student with your gifts, every time you tricked someone into giving you what you wanted, you felt a thrill you couldn't find anywhere else. The world and your society reward the most cunning and the strongest, and you live up to those ideals.

In the interest of protecting the city-states, the sorcerer-kings allow noble families to keep small armies of slave soldiers. Frequently, they use these soldiers to take action against other nobles or to protect their property. A sorcerer-king can, of course, call upon the nobles' soldiers to fight for his or her interests. And it's best to follow the sorcerer-king's commands.
	As one of your duties to your family, you were given charge of a legion of slave soldiers. You trained with them, developing your psionic talents so you could command them silently. (Though sometimes shouted commands and threats can intimidate your enemies far better than eerie silence.) The most skilled mind generals can keep up a continuous mental link, sharing sights and combat instincts with all the troops in the legion.

Just as the sun breaks the horizon, sending lambent waves washing across the countryside, the stands fill with eager spectators, pushing and shoving for the best view to the stage where the day's dramas will unfold. Suddenly, a half-dozen warriors explode from the gladiator gates. They flip and spin, their bone and obsidian blades flashing in the morning light. The crowd roars with delight, welcoming the jazst troupe to the city once more.
	Suddenly, a grating sound breaks through the cheers as a heavy gate lifts. The ground trembles, quieting the audience. The jazsts feign concern with exaggerated expressions, calling out to the crowd for aid. The beast gate yawns wide, birthing a ferocious creature, its horny carapace fitted with blades to catch and slash. It looses a thunderous roar as it charges. Before it can connect, the dancers scatter, tumbling away in a dazzling display that leaves the beast confused, blood streaming from a dozen cuts it never saw land.
	You have mastered the cruel techniques of the dangerous performers known as the jazst dancers. Unmatched in their skill with the blade, they weave a deadly dance on the arena floor, tumbling and capering as they deliver rapid-fire cuts and slashes to weaken and confuse their opponents. Your skills only improve in time, eclipsing those masters who first taught you as you became the greatest in the Seven Cities. Like your fellows, you draw out your fights, repeatedly springing into danger to impart a painful injury before slipping away.

The people need heroes. They need brave individuals to show them that adversity can be overcome no matter how tough the opposition. They need to witness battle to slake their thirst for blood, to vent their frustration and anger about their own lives. They need gladiators, for these bold warriors give them all they need and more.

You are the champion the people demand. You might have come from humble roots, having grown up as a slave or a criminal, or you could be a professional who chose this dangerous life for glory and coin. Regardless, something about you and your courage resonates with the people, and you become more than just another warrior fighting for your life in the pit. You are their hero.

A number of cults, sects, and secret societies devote themselves to the mighty elemental spirits of Athas. The priests of the Smoking Crown are one such sect. They are servants of the great fire-spirit dwelling in the Smoking Crown, the largest volcano on known Athas; by extension they are servants of volcanic spirits everywhere in the world.
	As a Smoking Crown initiate, you are one of the elite members of the priesthood. You carry a large burn scar on your chest, face, or hand as the sign of your allegiance. You are under no one's orders, nor do you command any lesser priests—all Smoking Crown priests are free to serve as they see fit. Many are wandering fire-scarred lunatics shouting wild prophecies in the wastes, but others are highly effective assassins, champions, and revolutionaries (you likely fall in the latter group). The only member of the priesthood with any special authority is the Keeper of the Smoking Temple, who guards a shrine hidden in the fiery depths of the mountain. Most Smoking Crown priests give aid and protection to other members of the sect when needed.
	The Smoking Crown is large and active by the standards of most elemental sects. Initiates travel widely throughout the Tyr Region, teaching people to respect the elemental spirits, exposing iniquity, and defending the weak against the depredations of the strong. Most of the Smoking Crown's wrath is directed in particular at Hamanu of Urik, because of the damage Urik's miners have inflicted in the obsidian quarries of the Smoking Crown.

On Athas, the rarest and most honored primal casters are those who evoke the spirits of elemental water. Healers of unmatched skill and bestowers of the blessed rains, they are held in reverence and awe by the common folk. Even vicious raiders and the cruelest slavers hesitate to harm or obstruct a rain priest, understanding that one who follows the rainbringer's path might very well save their lives someday by calling the rains to a parched desert or granting the gift of healing.
	You are one of these rare healers. Like many elemental priests, you are no friend to the sorcerer-kings, or any other defilers. The sorcerer-kings resent any who wield magic outside their own control, and you can expect to be watched closely by templars—or even arrested—if you are careless about revealing your powers. However, the people of the desert and the poor commoners of the cities revere your gifts and often go to great lengths to help you against the sorcerer-kings, the templars, and their informants.
	Although many rain-servants are pacifists, you are under no particular obligation to avoid violence or to bestow your healing on those who are not worthy of it. Sometimes the lesser harm lies in destroying a creature that otherwise would go on to inflict greater harm on others—or, in the case of defilers, on the world itself.

A merchant house has power and influence, soldiers and workers, but everything the house is depends on its representatives' efforts. The shady dealer represents one breed of dune trader, a skilled and treacherous agent specializing in intrigue and manipulation. Some shady dealers work as independent speculators and others act on a larger house's behalf. They still travel as dune traders, shepherding goods to places in need, but they always have an ulterior motive, seeking some rumor or bit of gossip to benefit themselves or their house.
	The image you cultivate masks a devious mind and a propensity for doing whatever you must to survive. Your skills at negotiation and intrigue serve you well: they let you confuse enemies and lure them into traps where your allies can strike. In time, your words and movements make fools of everyone you meet.

Caravans are the vital links in the chains of commerce binding outposts of civilization together across the wild wastelands of Athas. They come in many different forms from place to place—long files of slave porters, pack trains of heavily laden crodlus and kanks, wagons drawn by snorting inixes, and of course the towering mekillot-drawn argosy wagons that are wooden fortresses on wheels. Regardless of the beasts of burden or the goods carried, caravans are crucial to maintaining Athasian civilization. Not only do they carry valuable goods from one city to the next, they also carry rumors and tales of doings all across the Tyr Region to people thirsty for news of other places, provide travelers with the opportunity to surround themselves with the safety of numbers, and feed scores of desert outposts and settlements with a steady stream of food and supplies.
	Leading a successful caravan is no mean feat. Disaster in a hundred guises waits in the desert—hungry monsters, savage raiders, ruthless competitors, scourging sandstorms, unreliable wells, mutinous drivers, and the possibility that the goods turn out to be worth less than one paid for them when they reach market. From day to day, a caravan master might have to lead the guards and drivers in battle, search out a new path when a familiar road is buried in the shifting sands, bribe greedy officials, or enforce brutal discipline on a rebellious underling. It takes a rare combination of character judgment, business acumen, and physical courage—attributes you've cultivated for years. On the open desert, you are the master of your fate, and you wouldn't have it any other way.

People in the Tyr Region learn not to trust a performer blindly. An ordinary minstrel, a graceful dancer, or a honey-voiced singer might well be a killer sent by a bitter rival. Custom demands, however, that no entertainer be refused entry. The household should welcome such a guest regardless of any suspicions. Nevertheless, paranoid nobles might turn away one of these entertainers for fear of poison in their drink or a knife in their back.
	Those who refuse entry to a performer do so at risk to themselves. Even if the new arrival did not have malicious intent, a refusal is an insult few performers can bear, and such an affront makes enemies where there were none before.
	An unwelcome guest is a talented entertainer who uses his or her performer's status to infiltrate a target's house and get close enough to make the kill. Unwelcome guests master the use of poisons, hiding venoms and toxins about their persons for easy access when the opportunity to kill presents itself. Some unwelcome guests work alone, but many claim membership in an entertainer's troupe, an organization often rife with murderers, thieves, and saboteurs. Bards make the best unwelcome guests, but rogues, fighters, and assassins might find something in this path for themselves as well.

Throughout the Seven Cities of the Tyr Region, nobles surround themselves with retainers of good education, charming manners, and mastery of the arts. Many of these kept artists are just fops or decoration, but some are more than entertaining companions—they are skilled duelists and treasured advisors, deadly warriors never more than a few steps from their patron's side. In addition to beautifying the noble household with poetry and song, troubadours of this sort often serve as arms-instructors to young nobles and elite bodyguards trusted with the very lives of their patrons.
	Arms-troubadours are typically well educated, literate, skilled in an instrument or two, noteworthy poets, and equipped with aristocratic manners and refinement. Some begin as minor nobility attending wealthier and more important nobles, whereas others are descended from well-off merchants or commoners who set out to master the courtier's skills and seek out noble patronage. Most remain with a patron for a year or two before moving on, but others—especially those who come to be trusted as advisors and companions—might spend all their lives in a single noble's service.
	As an arms-troubadour, you might have a patron whose interests you look after during your adventures, or you could be between patrons. If so, given your fame and skill, your services might be very highly sought-after.

Some thri-kreen fully hone their natural physiology, turning their bodies into weapons deadlier than the gythka. They strengthen their extra arms for making claw attacks, practice graceful jumps with their powerful legs, and augment their natural venom so it is potent enough to take down tough prey. Because of their battle prowess, these kreen often become the strongest members of their packs. It is the thri-kreen way to challenge weaker leaders, and the greatest hunters rise to positions of leadership.

As you grow into the role of thri-kreen predator, you become larger and tougher, with thicker chitinous plates and stronger limbs. Along with these physical changes, your instincts and racial memories become more acute. You sense the long lineage of the kreen, and you understand the great hunts of the past and the long-forgotten tactics that let your race survive the most dangerous periods of Athasian history.

For some thri-kreen, these changes are natural—a hereditary gift. Others use psionic powers or martial training to strengthen themselves. Some find the predator's path after being exposed to sites or objects of power that stirred deep racial memories. No matter what triggered your transformation, you have become a kreen among kreen.

In the city-states, some enslaved goliaths work as enforcers, and the other residents know better than to say no when half-giant thugs come looking for goods or money. The physical might of these thugs ensures that they receive better treatment than most slaves do, and sometimes their children are set free (to appease the parent and guarantee loyalty).

Whether you serve as a slave or seek your own livelihood as a mercenary, violence and intimidation are your most useful tools. You get what you want by using your size, your attitude, and your keen knowledge of the back streets and seedy locations of your city-state. Anyone who's heard of you clears the way for you to pass, and thanks to your stature, they always see you coming.

Like many muls, you were born into slavery and, from your earliest childhood, endured brutal training for the arena or the armies of your noble house. For years you endured painful lessons, grueling conditioning, and the occasional lethal test of your skill until you became a killing machine. But despite everything that was done to you, your spirit remained free and unbroken. In time you left your owners' slave pens behind and set out to find your own fortune beneath the crimson sun.

Perhaps you are truly free, the master of your own fate after years of cruel bondage. Maybe you remain enslaved, but as a successful battle slave, you possess almost all the rights and luxuries of a wealthy free citizen. Whether you are a warrior who calls no one master or a prized champion who is a slave in name only, you carry the harsh lessons of your upbringing. Now it is your choice whether to fight for gold, for glory, for love, or for hate, but regardless of your motivation, you cannot escape the simple fact that fighting is what you do best.

You have fought myriad battles, each a contest to determine who was strongest, who was most worthy of the champion's mantle. You survived these battles through brute strength, speed, and toughness, but you always sensed something else, something truly monstrous, threatening to break free in the thick of battle. At one glorious point, your prowess grew mighty enough that the monster emerged. It burst through your self-control and transformed you into a raging killer. All finesse, planning, and moderation fell away. Only an unspeakable craving for blood and a terrible talent for producing it remained.
	Fighters are distinguished by a mastery at arms and the rigorous control they apply in desperate situations. Every warrior must come to terms with anger in combat, to channel it in useful ways lest he or she become ruled by it. To fail is to wind up dead, skewered on an enemy weapon. Still, a few fighters surrender completely to their anger, girding themselves in hatred's armor and powering their strikes with rampant ferocity.

  By the time you reach 11th level, your training in magic merges with your martial expertise. You can now shape arcane energy into useful attacks. Where other knights might choose the path of the stalwart knight, you find another road that leads you to perfecting your unusual style and defeating your enemies' expectations. 
  You might join the Sword Guard at the City of Starlight to hone your techniques, or you might go your own way, learning your techniques through trial and error. Regardless of how you come to these abilities, the result is a deadly fusion of magic and steel, until you become an eldritch knight who can withstand any foe.

You believe that a great destiny awaits anyone who has the audacity to take fate into his or her own hands. Self-awareness, confidence, and a sharp eye for opportunity allow a hero to reach a destiny, yet sometimes destiny needs a little bit of help. And that's where you come in.

You teach your comrades and followers the principles of self-empowerment to help them reach for greater heights. You believe that someone who is alert and grabs opportunities as they come can triumph against any adversary. A force of balance is at work within the world, and fortune, fate, luck, or chance—whatever you care to call it—gathers around the bold like an invisible mantle. Fortune rarely smiles for long on those who prey on others or who stand on the side of iniquity; their day of ill fortune comes eventually. You intend to be there when it does.

Those you lead see you as a good luck charm. They feel empowered in your presence, believing that you have a supernatural gift that improves their chances. You, on the other hand, understand that luck is made, not found. You know that if luck and fate do guide the destinies of you and your friends, without the proper effort and outlook, those destinies will never be fulfilled.

  You desired more fluidity of form and motion than what the masters taught you, so you reached out to a creature you knew would grant the abilities you seek. By claiming the chaos beast as your totem creature, you can take its form, and, in doing so, the form of any shape that its aberrant mind could imagine. Chaos beasts continually change form, and their strength comes from inflicting changes upon their unwilling foes. In taking their form, such as it is, you grow more powerful. Your body does not move like other creatures. You gain the upper hand by warping your limbs and contorting your joints in unnatural ways, leaving your enemies unable to predict your attacks.

  Your mind is the gateway through which you imprint your will upon the world. In your studies, you have searched for more powerful ways of asserting that will. By choosing the mind flayer as your totem creature, you've gained some of the illithid's natural prowess at bending the wills of lesser beings.
  This connection has taught you hidden secrets of mental dominion, and you've found that they can also be applied to the shamanic practice of summoning spirit companions. In order to bind your new spirit companion to your will, you had to prove your dominance over it. Your spirit companion was cowed, to the point that it is more slave than friend. Even so, you know that if you let your guard down for a moment, the slave will try to become the master.

It seemed you would never grow comfortable with your strange talent and yet, against all odds, you did. You developed your concentration to drive back outside influences, but you still can't remember the last time you were alone in your head.
Training, focus, or natural adaptability has let you control the voices invading your thoughts. You can now single them out and use them to warn you of hidden dangers or to find ways around a foe's defenses. In effect, your supernatural senses give you cues to leading and fighting in battle

All across Kara-Tur, runepriests go from village to village teaching not only literacy, but also the lessons found in the Path of Enlightenment. Such selfless acts, in turn, bring these runepriests closer to their own enlightenment. Recognizing this truth, a few shan zi learn how to share their blessings with their comrades and allies, further pushing back the darkness so that the light of the Celestial Emperor can purge the world of ignorance and evil. The following paragon path is available to any honorable runepriest who strives to become the consummate leader, acting through his or her allies to vanquish the opposition.

Executioners who reach the paragon tier have proven themselves more than capable of carrying out assassinations (both clandestine and public) without being caught or killed themselves. For you, simple political assassinations and hired killings begin to lose their luster, because city watchmen or the bodyguards of local merchants rarely challenge your skills. Your abilities are better utilized stalking more powerful quarry—those that threaten the entire world, if not the planes themselves.

As a soul binder, you have bound a soul to your service. The soul might be that of an enemy whose torment you wish to prolong, a loved one whose company you wish to keep, or a friend whom you’re saving from a vile afterlife. Regardless of your reasons, the soul must protect and serve you.

You have fought fiercely for this accolade, and members of the Third Coil accord you the respect you have earned as one of Zehir's most zealous servants.
	As a fang of Zehir, your overriding concern is feeding as many souls as possible to your god. You are a holy slayer, dispatched on special missions by Zehir and his high priests.

  Drawing their power from the primal magic of the veil, the Moonrise seekers dispatch their opponents into the Feywild with the aid of the lunar spirits. In service to the Maiden of the Moon, these seekers try to keep their enemies off balance, using powers such as lunar transposition and echoing shot to rearrange the battlefield as they see fit.

Many primordials lie unconscious in their bonds, but Vezzuvu, the Queen of the Burning Mountain, still harbors both awareness and reason. Vezzuvu long ago determined that her road to freedom was to win the devotion (or fear) of mortal followers, and thereby become an elemental god. She can no longer stride the world or reign over an elemental domain, but she can still shake the mortal world by exerting her will on places of elemental power or bestowing on others the ability to call upon her essence.
	As a herald of Vezzuvu, you have been gifted with a portion of the primordial's awesome abilities. You can wield this talent as you like, since Vezzuvu wants others who see your prowess to be drawn to her worship. The Queen of the Burning Mountain requires little from you most of the time, but her interests are erratic; you might walk the world for years without any messages from her, only to be sent suddenly to quell a volcanic rift, destroy the temple of an evil god, or seek out an artifact held by a frost titan.

Your rapport with the elemental powers has grown to such a degree that they regard you as one of their own. Throughout the heroic tier, you established yourself as an able partner, ally, and, perhaps, servant of the elemental powers and in doing so earned greater and greater elemental rewards, including advanced arcane knowledge and more powerful spells. So armed, you stand ready to face even greater threats and reap even greater rewards.
	The elemental powers' favor grants you deeper insights into elemental magic. Not only can your gen servant fetch potent spells, but you can pierce the barriers between the planes to draw forth power to serve your needs. Such command over creation's fundamental forces translates into an improved gen servant that, at your command, can manifest the Elemental Chaos's unruly energies in effective and dangerous ways. Not only does your gen servant improve, but when you master all the elemental gifts, you can transform your servant into a powerful elemental monolith.

The most devoted students of the elements often withdraw from the society of fellow mortals to contemplate the deep truths of existence. You have chosen the lonely path of the elemental anchorite, dedicating yourself to a life of austerity and reflection. When your companions return to home, family, and high honors after their adventures, you instead seek solitude in places of great elemental power. The secrets of the universe are engraved in the stone of mighty mountains and whispered by the winds that sigh across lonely deserts.
	Some elemental anchorites seek isolation in order to master ever more formidable abilities, using elemental essence to further whatever purposes they deem important. Others are more philosophical, and view themselves as servants of balance who act to check the excesses of forces, monsters, or villains that disturb the natural equilibrium of the world. The purpose to which you put your understanding of elemental forces is ultimately up to you.

From brooding fortresses in the Elemental Chaos, the Doomguard watches the decay of the cosmos and its unstoppable slide into dissolution. These stoic warriors believe the universe's fate was sealed when the gods defeated the primordials, because imprisoning these entities kept them from sustaining the world and thus doomed it. The Doomlords are the Doomguard's champions, warriors aligned against those who espouse order and perpetuate corrupt and tyrannical regimes. As is true of their cousins, the Doomguard Marauders (Manual of the Planes), the ranks of the Doomlords include both valiant champions of freedom and murderous anarchists.

The darkness of the Abyss is a deep wound in the center of the Elemental Chaos,a bleak vortex that births the planes' myriad evils. Corruption flows out from this darkening pit to infect the land and creatures and twist them to evil. During your adventures, you encountered abyssal energy-perhaps when you slew a demon or after you explored a tainted site. The corruption changed you, infected you, and exposed you to horrid evil. Now it is all you can do to hold that evil at bay.

All realms see their share of swashbuckling types, whose love for freedom and a happy-go-lucky attitude belie their combat prowess. But the Feywild has given rise to a particularly exotic type of swashbuckler, whose fighting style defies gravity. These daring adventurers are known as soaring rakes.
	Soaring rakes gain their uncanny abilities through a variety of paths, though each has a profound link to the Feywild, either from being born in that realm or through a direct connection to one of the Feywild powers (such as being a fey pact warlock or having the Fey Bond feat). This connection to the Feywild and its ambient magic allows soaring rakes to take to the skies at will. Due to the added element of flight, soaring rakes develop a unique fighting style, and many consider them the ultimate skirmishers.
	Most soaring rakes have an outlook on life that mimics their abilities. Problems, dangers, and frustrations affect them less than most, since the rakes can take to the air and leave their worries behind them. In keeping with their carefree attitude, the vast majority of soaring rakes turn to Avandra for worship, trusting in the god of luck to see them through any challenge.

Among the archfey, few entities are more mysterious than the Maiden of the Moon. Elusive even to others of her kind, the Maiden of the Moon has only one apparent interest: removing the blight of lycanthropy, both from the Feywild and from the natural world. On the boundaries of the lycanthrope realm of Brokenstone Vale, some who have survived being ravaged by those creatures find inspiration from the Maiden of the Moon, taking up arms to hunt and slay the lycanthropes. In honor of the Maiden, they call themselves the moon hunters.
	Moon hunters are attuned to the power of the Feywild's moon, which is larger and brighter than the full moon in the natural world. They can channel its power to harm lycanthropes and other shapeshifting foes. In this manner, they are similar to the fey giants known as firbolgs. Like those hunters, they travel across the Feywild, calling forth auras of moonfire to reveal their enemies in the darkness. Once they find their prey, many use crescent-shaped blades to cut their foes down in a bloody harvest.
	In time, most moon hunters expand their hunt to include all creatures that take on another form to prey upon innocent folk, including rakshasas, doppelgangers, hags, oni, and lamias.

Eachthighern (pronounced "Whitehorn"), the Lord of Unicorns, is one of the most respected archfey in the Court of Stars. His wisdom is valued and respected by Queen Tiandra, and rival archfey such as Baba Yaga begrudgingly acknowledge his strength. Unlike most other archfey, Eachthighern takes mortal heroes as his personal knights and sends them forth to stamp out evil creatures wherever they are found.
	When Eachthighern needs a new knight, he sends a herald to one of his choices. These heralds are usually eladrin bards, but sometimes he assigns this duty to more exotic fey such as centaurs or unicorns. The herald transports the prospective knight to the Serene Glade, where Eachthighern makes his offer. If the person refuses the offer, Eachthighern is saddened but respects the candidate's wishes. The herald then takes the person back, but this former candidate loses the memories of the audience thanks to the use of a special type of oblivion moss. If the candidate accepts the offer, the Lord of Unicorns touches the person with his horn, in a manner similar to a king knighting a squire. If the newly accepted knight desires it, he or she receives Eachthighern's heraldic symbol of a unicorn rampant in a field of deep blue, but such displays aren't mandatory because Feywild natives instinctively recognize Lord Eachthighern's mark upon the knight.
	A White Horn knight's quests include anything from rescuing slaves from fomorian holds to guiding travelers safely through dangerous woodlands plagued by mad dryads, sly verbeeg, or ferocious owlbears. The knights count evil fey such as lamias and hags as their greatest opponents, because these creatures often hunt unicorns for their hearts and horns, which such dark fey use in their horrid rituals.
	A White Horn knight is blessed with some of the Lord of Unicorns' power and gains the service of a loyal unicorn steed. The knight's abilities mark the character as a valiant leader in the fight against evil. Though most White Horn knights pay ultimate homage to their lord, some also serve Corellon.

Having embraced the dark side of divine magic, you are now ready to delve deeper into the forbidden, to fully embrace the power offered by the dark forces of the cosmos. Only those who have committed evil are invited to study these black arts. Through the filthy deeds you have done and the wickedness in your heart, you have proven yourself worthy.
	Dabbling in occult mysteries carries a heavy price in body, mind, and soul. To harness the magic these entities offer, you must carve your f lesh with blasphemies. To understand the rites, you must push your mind to madness's brink. To prepare your soul, you must indulge in every evil, wallowing in the horror of it all.
	Where paladins fight for honor, good, and order, idols of darkness are treacherous, wicked, and capricious in their dealings. They kill for pleasure. They maim to learn from their victim's suffering. They never hesitate to feed their ambition and to grow their temporal power—they know that beyond the mortal coil lies only annihilation.

You have nothing to fear from things you control. It's the things you can't control that can ruin you. As a demonologist, you know this lesson well. When you look into the eye of the Abyss, you have no doubt in your mind that you can learn to master it—one demon at a time, if need be.
	You have never shrunk from looking into shady places to serve your ambition. The longer you peer into darkness, the more certain you become that the secret to overwhelming power is hidden in the Abyss. 	
	As a consequence of your studies, you have gained the attention of a minor demon—a filthy quasit. Discussions with this companion have expanded your mind to grim new possibilities. At the same time, the lessons have dissipated any reservations that perhaps you have gone too far. The more you learn from this quasit, the greater the power you control. Thus far, you have blithely ignored a nagging suspicion that somehow things might go terribly wrong.

Anyone can kill under the right circumstances. Every city boasts hundreds of people willing and able to do the deed, given the motivation. What differentiates you from other would-be killers is your consummate professionalism. You aren't deluded by a purported darkness deep in your heart or some religious obsession. You know your job and you do it well, without fuss, without mess. As a result, your employers return time and time again.
	All kinds of rogues and assassins become contract killers. They take to this path because it provides a steady revenue stream while indulging their talents and inclinations. Scoundrels from other classes adopt this profession once they determine that their consciences raise no objection.

You might choose to take on powers from a second class in place of a paragon path. If you have the Novice Power, Acolyte Power, and Adept Power feats for a class, you can choose to continue to gain powers from that class rather than take a paragon path. If you choose this option, you gain several benefits.
    At 11th level, you can choose to replace one of your at-will powers with an at-will power from your second class.
    In place of the paragon path encounter power gained at 11th level, you can select any encounter power of 7th level or lower from your second class.
    In place of the paragon path utility power gained at 12th level, you can select any utility power of 10th level or lower from your second class.
    In place of the paragon path daily power gained at 20th level, you can select any daily power of 19th level or lower from your second class.
    Psionic Augmentation: If either of your classes has the Psionic Augmentation class feature and you choose paragon multiclassing, the benefits you gain at 11th level are different from those noted above.
    If your first and second classes both have the Psionic Augmentation class feature, at 11th level you gain 2 power points and an at-will attack power of 7th level or lower from your second class.
    If your first class has the Psionic Augmentation class feature and your second class doesn't have it, at 11th level you gain an at-will attack power from your second class as well as an encounter attack power of 7th level or lower from that class.
    If your first class doesn't have the Psionic Augmentation class feature and your second class does have it, at 11th level you lose one at-will attack power from your first class but gain 2 power points and an at-will attack power of 7th level or lower from your second class.

For centuries, the Oak Shields have guarded the wild areas of the world. Oak Shields, like their namesake trees, are known for longevity, hardiness, and loyalty. Legends claim that Melora personally trained the first members of the order, providing them with the secrets of using everspring groves and standing stones. Ancient sites such as these might hold information on how Melora's faithful can benefit from them.
	Each aspiring Oak Shield studies under a master. Together, the student and the master meditate beneath a sacred oak, seeking enlightenment about the natural world. The student learns to interpret the whispers of the primal spirits and to understand the wisdom of the changing seasons. During this time, he or she comes to appreciate when to stand tall against the wind and when to bend when the wind is too strong. In addition, the student learns about the complexity of the world, how something as simple as a tree can have multiple aspects to its nature. An Oak Shield applies these lessons to his or her life's work as a guardian of the natural order, remaining steadfast in the face of adversity and providing shelter during the storm.

Veiled masters are drawn primarily from the ranks of martial artists who have learned to perceive the world around them with little or no light. In keeping with your veiled master training, you prefer to attack from hiding, either striking from existing shadow or wrapping yourself in the gloom you learn to create. The features of the veiled master path reward those of a stealthy disposition, including monks, rogues, rangers, and other lightly armored warriors.

From time to time, the Raven Queen's gaze lingers on a mortal soul whose courage and devotion sparks her cold heart. To these mortals she sends a special boon—a raven-shaped shadow whose appearance is a sign of her favor.
	Those who gain this blessing are known as ravenkin, and from that point on they are never truly alone. The shadow raven that keeps them company is a physical connection to the god of death. Devout worshipers of the Raven Queen are the most common ravenkin. However, some ravenkin are recent converts to her faith, unsure of what they have done to warrant such a gift.
	Since the blessing that marked you as a ravenkin, you have been aware that you are watched by the Raven Queen. Some might grow uneasy under such scrutiny, but you embrace it, knowing that you have a special place in the god's plans.

Your innate connection to shadow, night, and the freedom you find within the darkness led you to the nocturnal path. By embracing this connection, you begin to wield the power shared by the shadowy predators that preceded you. You can step between this world and the world of shadow, summoning the aid of your nocturnal packmates from that shadow in times of need.

The ancient order of the dark watchers was founded by arcanists who mastered the power of shadow, then matched that power with a righteous understanding of the light of life and the Astral Sea. As a dark watcher, you are a vigilant guardian of the light of life and the natural world. The power taught to you by the order grants you unmatched defensive prowess, allowing you to protect yourself and your allies from the forces of darkness. Only by embracing the shadow can its corruption be turned to light—or so you believe.

Your tradition originated with gnomes of the Feydark, who escaped their fomorian masters by mastering shadow magic to make their innate talent for illusions even more potent. Like those gnomes, you are an illusionist at heart, building your tactics on deception and misdirection. The shadowstuff you infuse into your spells makes those illusions a tangible part of the battlefield.

  For those who wish to control their foes from a distance, there is no better totem creature than the beholder. Ocular adepts are seekers who wish to control everything they see. They possess minds bursting with energy, looking for release. The first and greatest expression of the link with your totem creature is the manifestation of a spiriteye.
  This weapon resembles nothing more than a ghostly eye which floats in front of the ocular adept. Despite its appearance, a seeker can use some of the principles learned with a mundane ranged weapons to fight with the spiriteye. It takes intense concentration and manipulation of the psionic and primal magics to create the spiriteye, but in time, the ocular adept gains mastery of the weapon and can control it with thought alone.
  Like the eye tyrant, you can make several swift attacks at range and float across the battlefield to a safer location. Attacks made with your spiriteye resemble the beholder's dreaded eye rays, and you have the same variety of effects with them (albeit with less control).

You have chosen to draw upon the power of the aberrant creature that brings madness by its mere presence: the gibbering mouther. Your warcry carries the sound of a thousand voices, all shouting different things. Those who hear you claw at their ears, your voice infecting their thoughts and filling their hearts with terror.
  With this power comes a change. Your mind... is different, somehow. Some thoughts come only with difficulty, but at times, you know things that your friends and allies believe you had no way of knowing. You may sometimes try to share your unique viewpoint with others, but even your most innocuous comment brings pain.

The advantage of getting the drop on an enemy is acknowledged far and wide. Equally prized is the benefit of  taking out important targets with little risk. No one is better at accomplishing either task than a trained sharpshooter, and the sharpshooter's weapon of choice is the crossbow.
	Nations and mercenary groups train specialized soldiers to use crossbows in this fashion. Underworld organizations do the same. Any such soldier is essentially an assassin who knows how to use a crossbow to slay from a distance without attracting notice. Dwarves in particular prize this exception to their normally straightforward battle tactics. That race produces fine snipers.
	Such shooters don't shy away from a normal fight. They understand that reconnaissance and a plan, along with the ability to strike unseen from a great distance, are great advantages in a combat situation. A good ambush leaves the enemy weakened and confused, giving any follow up assault a better chance of working.
	You have chosen to hone your skills along these lines. You prefer to strike from hiding with a wellplaced shot and to remain unobserved during a confrontation, aiding your allies by picking off foes without ever drawing notice. The hand crossbow is your preferred weapon.
	Sniping is the ultimate tactic for you. The sound of a bolt finding its target is the sweet toll of victory. A bolt you fire might take out a sentry in a single hit, as well as sending your enemies scurrying for cover. If you miss, no matter. You can slink back into the shadows until you have a chance to shoot again.

Mastery of a chosen armament is a long standing tradition among many peoples. Legends are full of examples: the fighter who is one with his sword or the assassin who can't miss with knives. Fables also tell of those who have consummate proficiency with the bow or the crossbow. Some warriors acquire skill with the bow to avoid close combat. Others do so because ability and purpose lead them that way. Archers work for all sorts of causes, military to mercenary, noble to malevolent. One example is the battlefield archer (Player's Handbook), a tactical shooter that works well in the chaos of small-unit combat.
	Unlike other archers, the sharpshooter's purpose is to become legendary for accuracy and skill, as well as for the number and sorts of foes defeated. Quick shooting, accuracy, and deadliness are the sharpshooter's trademarks, along with the ability to use a bow or a crossbow in ways that few others can. Some who would become the ultimate sharpshooter look for other archers to challenge in contests of skill or even in duels to the death.
	You have honed your bow or crossbow skills with a desire to become the best of the best. You fire faster than most folk would think possible. When enemies try to move in close and shut you down, you shoot on without compromising defense. Those who watch you work could swear your arrows are alive. One day, you'll be targeting that one enemy whose defeat will make you a legend.

A covert clan of enigmatic monks engage in assassination, espionage, and sabotage. They are mercenaries, taking commissions from the powerful or the vengeful. Members of the Unseen Hand are bound to the order for life, the clan's mysteries are too sensitive to allow any member to withdraw or resign.
	Secrecy and subtlety lie at the heart of your training. As long as your enemies cannot identify your purpose, you have them at a disadvantage. You might achieve this subterfuge through cunning disguises, skulking through shadows, or misdirection. Mastering the higher mysteries helps you manipulate darkness, leap across vast distances, and penetrate your enemies' minds.
	Being a trained killer is not so different from being any other kind of warrior, but you must ensure that your tactics and techniques do not alarm your companions. At the same time, you must maintain friendly relations with the Unseen Hand clan or face ostracism, retribution or worse.

Spell commanders are artificers who transform their allies into walking weapons of arcane destruction. Typically found as a part of more militaristic arcane institutions, spell commanders learn magic that help them increase their allies' spell power. Additionally, most spell commanders work as a part of a small squad, and many of the spells they wield are focused around small squad tactics, including rapidly moving across the battlefield.
Most spell commanders receive standard military training, including the foundation of small arms use (particularly bows and crossbows). Spell commanders combine conventional military education with their arcane knowledge to create a more hybridized approach to warfare.
As a spell commander, you know how to combine traditional combat techniques and weapon use with the power of arcane magic. Your focus is on transforming your allies into more accurate, more powerful, and more mobile forces, effectively taking on the role of a squad leader who uses spells to facilitate this transformation.
