You are a monster, fated and infected by a vile curse that transformed you into a creature of nightmare. Normal emotions have become alien to you. Only cold, gnawing hunger remains.
	Most of those who become vampires are victims of monstrous attacks, created by a callous hunter who drained them dry of blood and life force, then cast them aside. Others seek out this path from their own fear of infirmity and death, discovering the arcane rites and alchemical formulas that promise dark power. In some cases, a character finds his or her vampirism invoked by an ancient family curse, or that he or she is a member of an extended clan of vampires who pass their blood down to those they deem worthy—whether by choice or not.
	Whatever their origins, vampire characters are not slaves to their creators. Even those beholden to an older vampire retain free will, and have a chance to avoid sinking into the bestial depravity so common among their kind. Vampire characters are the most exceptional examples of those who carry this dark curse, using their powers not solely for murder and personal gain. Some become the greatest of heroes, but even those vampires are aware that few among the common folk have the ability to see past the frightening reality of their dark nature. Avoiding the scrutiny of superstitious folk and disguising his or her needs and abilities serves a vampire best. Trusted companions, enemies to slay and feast upon, and reasons to avoid civilized areas for extended times make an adventuring life the perfect choice for such characters.

The world knows paladins to be shining paragons who champion lofty ideals such as compassion, nobility, sacrifice, and valor. Such virtuous figures are symbols to the common people, icons from which they draw the strength and courage to stand fast against the encroaching darkness. Yet in every light a shadow lurks - the brightness of these noble warriors is equaled by the shadow spreading from their sinister counterparts.

Some warriors fight for gold. Others seek glory, power, or prestige. There are a few, however, who seek the warrior's path for reasons that transcend the material and mundane. Called by divine powers to stand as champions of the light against the ever-encroaching darkness, paladins fight not because they choose to, but because, deep within their souls, they know they must. The paladin's life is not a choice. It is a destiny.
     Paladins are holy warriors, defenders of good and enemies of evil. Paladins are well trained with their weapons and armor, but they augment that skill with divine powers that allow them to shield their allies and smite their enemies. A single paladin can turn the tide of an entire war through a combination of skill at arms and inspiring leadership. As icons of virtue and heroism, paladins are a deadly threat to those who would rule through fear, intimidation, and violence.
     Paladins typically wander the land either alone or in small groups. They seek out wrongs to right and villainy to defeat. Most paladins begin as squires to more experienced holy warriors. Through training and arduous tests, a squire's bravery, battle skill, and ethics are all tested to see if the squire is worthy of becoming a paladin.
     A cavalier is a paladin who has embraced one of the heroic virtues, such as compassion, justice, sacrifice, or valor. His or her belief in this virtue is so strong that it manifests as divine magic. Although many cavaliers pledge their faith to the gods, others follow no specific religion. Regardless of one's divine affiliation (or lack thereof), a cavalier's virtue stands paramount. It guides his or her actions, pointing to the best way to protect the ever-flickering light of hope and civilization in the world.
	 Opposing the cavaliers and the virtues that they champion are the blackguards, who embody the dreaded vices that the cavaliers stand against. Where cavaliers embrace compassion, justice, sacrifice, and valor, blackguards epitomize fury, tyranny, greed, and terror. Since the earliest days of history, these two factions have fought each other. Both wander the land, gathering allies and working to further the cause of their virtues or vices.
     At one time, cavaliers formed into chivalrous orders that were dedicated to the ideal of protecting the civilized realms. The forgotten kingdoms that ruled the land relied on cavaliers to help keep the peace. Those cavaliers maintained not only the military security of the land, but also its moral strength. A cavalier might drive off a marauding troll, but she could also mediate a dispute between two farmers, break the power of a corrupt noble, or free a wrongly accused prisoner.
     As with many things from the time of the forgotten kingdoms, the cavaliers' glory proved fleeting. The kingdoms of old grew weak, and some of their decline could be laid at the feet of cavaliers who strayed from the righteous path. All too often, cavaliers fell victim to the very evils they had sworn to combat. Power corrupts, and in many cases cavaliers served as perfect examples of how power can twist the most resolute heart.
     The grand orders of cavaliers have long since faded, but their glory is not forgotten. Even as evil casts its shadow across the land, there are those who hear the call to the cavalier's path. Many of the cavaliers of old strayed from their purpose, but that purpose and the power behind it remains strong for those who stay true to it.

The world experiences perpetual cycles of life, death, and rebirth. The four seasons are signposts that mark the world's progress through time, each with its own recognizable traits. The mortal races have learned to live in harmony with this cycle, using the bounty of spring, summer, and autumn to enable them to endure the desolation of winter. In you, that harmony manifests itself in a special way. You have learned to harness the greatest power of the natural world: that of primal magic.
     Druids are guardians of the world. They provide guidance to the common folk and tend to villages, towns, and vast stretches of unspoiled land in the same way that a gardener keeps watch over his flowers and vegetables. A druid works to ensure that the natural order remains strong. A wise druid allows a band of hunting goblins to gather food and game for their survival. But if those same goblins wreak havoc purely for the joy of destruction, the druid calls upon primal magic to smite and scatter them. As long as creatures live within the cycle of nature, a druid lives and lets live.
     Druids provide guidance and protection to farmers, wild animals, and plants in equal measure. In a druid's eyes, all living creatures have the same right to live within the world. A druid might help a village plant crops, but then turn against the villagers if they hunt to near extinction the wolves that prey on their cattle. Balance is the key to maintaining nature's integrity.

Warlocks manipulate arcane power, as wizards do, but their conduit to that power is vastly different. For a warlock, it's as much about who you know as what you know - and in effect, the two are the same.
	All warlocks gain access to their power by entering into a pact with some force or entity in which that power rests. In return for their continuing loyalty and service to the source of their power, warlocks become more adept at their craft, and the abilities they bring to the battlefield grow more lethal.

Assassins combine best with other striker classes since doing so provides two methods for dealing striker damage. The strongest combinations include assassin/rogue, assassin/monk, and assassin/ranger. If you want to develop leader techniques, the assassin/bard is a good choice. For defender, think about the assassin/paladin to improve your durability and gain self-healing. Combining an assassin with controller classes is difficult since few abilities overlap. To add control techniques, you are served better by picking up the sorcerer or warlock. Although they are not controllers, many spells available to them have controller effects. </specific>

You have accepted your dark reflection and understand its place in your soul. Yet you are unwilling to surrender completely to the darkness you now harbor. 

What drove you to seek out the Shadowfell's power? Were you driven by grief, guilt, hatred, or vengeance? Something else? Is your divided focus the result of an incomplete bond? Or do you dabble in other areas to better conceal your sinister nature?

As a hybrid assassin, you can call forth shrouds to help guide your attacks where they can deal the most damage, but you sacrifice many of the techniques assassins use to evade their enemies.

The best hybrid combination for this class is ranger/seeker, creating a ranged attack specialist. Your Wisdom and Dexterity scores should be equally high, with Strength a good third choice.

The rogue/seeker can pick up ranged attacks from both classes, using thrown daggers or a hand crossbow rather than a longbow. Ability score assignment is difficult; you'll need high Wisdom and Dexterity scores, and your secondary ability options require some tough choices.

The fighter/seeker can be a mighty warrior. Strength and Wisdom should be your top ability scores. </specific>

The battlemind/fighter has plenty of durability, but you'll need to assign high scores to both Strength and Constitution, with Wisdom as your third-best score.

The ardent/battlemind also needs two high scores—Constitution and Charisma—but can manage without a third good score. This combination also gives you the full array of power points for your augmentable powers.

A battlemind/warlock can get away with only one high ability score (Constitution), and Charisma makes a great secondary score for both classes. Unfortunately, you're a little fragile for a defender, so either shore up those defenses or find a tough ally to stand next to. </specific>

The ardent/bard is a great combination thematically,
and the two classes' roles and key ability scores match. It's easy to imagine a character who taps into others' emotions through both mental manipulation and song.

If you prefer to stay fully psionic, the ardent/battlemind delivers durability in battle and retains important leader functions.

One can easily compare the emotional discipline of an ardent to that required to be a paladin, and mixing these two classes creates an interesting hybrid. Charisma should be your best ability score, with Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom all vying for second place. </specific>

Like most ardents, your psionic power comes from self-discovered potential rather than training. Why did you choose not to focus on honing your talent for harnessing emotion? Do you fear this ability, preferring to supplement it with the abilities of another class? Have you only begun to unlock this mysterious power?

As a hybrid ardent, you provide occasional but timely bursts of emotion to allies and enemies alike. However, by blending this power with the talents of another class, you give up the depth of your control over others' emotions.

Whether student or tinkerer, you have learned many tricks for imbuing magic into objects and creatures. Your expertise is spotty, however, with many gaps that a true artificer might scoff at. Of course, you know plenty of tricks beyond the skill of that artificer.

Why does your knowledge have such gaps? Do you lack the discipline or talent to master some of the formulas and recipes of the artificer? Or have you recognized that technical skills must be supplemented with other abilities?

As a hybrid artificer, you retain some of the artificer's healing ability, but you trade away magic item manipulation in exchange for another class's abilities.

The fighter/warden offers great durability and melee attacks, though this combination might need some help with AC; Warden's Armored Might or Fighter Armor Proficiency are good fixes.

Adding the hybrid cleric gives the hybrid warden useful healing powers; Wisdom is likely your secondary ability.

To stand strong against the defilers of the natural world, you have buttressed your primal tenacity with the capabilities of another class. These capabilities might be other ways of channeling primal spirits, or you might have decided that you can't count on the spirits for all your strength.

As a hybrid warden, you can still punish foes for attacking your allies. However, because you divide your focus between two classes, you must give up some of the class's innate durability (in the form of Font of Life and Guardian Might).

You know the innate power of arcane magic flowing through your body and blood, yet it does not speak to you as strongly as it would if you were only a sorcerer.

Is your sorcerous bloodline diluted, requiring you to learn other talents to survive as an adventurer? Or do you fear what might happen if you gave yourself fully to the luring pulse of magic?

As a hybrid sorcerer, you're capable of unleashing powerful gouts of arcane fury. But you don't have the resilience of a nonhybrid sorcerer or the other quirks derived from a dedication to sorcerous ways.

    <specific name="Supplemental"> Selecting Druid Powers

Despite automatically gaining the wild shape power, a hybrid druid doesn't come with beast form powers; you must select them from your limited array of druid powers.
At 1st level, you should consider selecting a beast form power as your lone druid at-will power. You can use your other at-will power in humanoid form even if that power isn't a druid power. (Human hybrid druids can afford to pick up both a beast form  and a nonbeast form druid at-will power.)
If you don't have any beast form powers, you're wasting wild shape, so include beast form powers among your attack powers and utility powers. Having a beast form power you can use in every encounter makes your wild shape more valuable.

Suggested Combinations
The druid/shaman is an ideal combination of primal classes, mixing the druid's control and melee powers with the shaman's leadership. 

A druid/invoker mixes powers and features from two different Wisdom-based controller classes and can offer an interesting character background: What brought you to mesh the ancient power of the gods with the might of primal spirits?

Hybrid druids who want to increase their deadliness in melee should consider the avenger, ranger, and rogue classes. </specific>

Your ability to take on the form of a beast marks you unmistakably as a druid, but your bond to the spirits of nature remains somewhat tenuous. Do your druid powers stem from an innate but undeveloped link to primal spirits? Or have you just begun to explore the mysteries of nature after a life spent in other pursuits? 
As a hybrid druid, you can assume beast form and likely know powers useful in that form. However, you sacrifice some connections to the natural world—including Primal Aspect and Ritual Casting—to explore another class's talents.

The bard and warlock classes make a good hybrid combination, with complete overlap between primary and secondary abilities. Focus on ranged implement attacks when choosing bard powers.

A bard/paladin can mix leadership and defense and maintain accuracy with Charisma attack powers. You'll need a little help with AC, particularly if you're the only defender in the group.

In your heart, you know the power of rage. However, your link to the primal spirits that unleash these rages isn't quite as strong as a typical barbarian's. Perhaps you've been away from the tribe for too long, or maybe you have only begun to harness primal power. Regardless of the reason, as a hybrid barbarian you can't unleash the burning rage in your heart quite as easily as a full member of that class, but you remain capable of occasional frenzied bursts of energy.

The avenger/invoker enjoys a variety of melee and nonmelee attacks, all based on Wisdom. You can control enemies at a distance, making it even easier for you to hunt down your prey.

The avenger/wizard seems like an unusual combination at first glance, but both classes suggest the study of secret lore. With good Wisdom and Intelligence scores, you can achieve the same variety of attacks as an avenger/invoker can. </specific>

As a hybrid wizard, you're not particularly durable, so you must choose your second hybrid class, as well as your powers, with care.

The swordmage shares the same key ability, but that class's predilection for melee combat is at odds with the typical wizard's preference for staying out of the fray. To keep up in melee, select a good mix of close attack powers and some feats that improve your survivability. Alternatively, focus your swordmage power selection on ranged powers and area powers and enter melee only as a last resort.

A cleric/wizard who has good Intelligence and Wisdom scores can safely and effectively remain in the back ranks while supporting allies with battlefield control and healing.

Adding the avenger class to your hybrid wizard allows you to surprise your enemies with the occasional deadly melee attack. Taking Armor of Faith through the Hybrid Talent feat gives you the boost to AC you need to stay close enough to deliver such an attack. </specific>

A sorcerer/warlock can be a potent striker, with Charisma as the highest ability score.

Combining the warlock with the wizard creates a synergistic power list, and the wizard's key ability, Intelligence, is a good secondary ability for the warlock.

Most hybrid swordmages sacrifice some of their defense for greater versatility. Combining the hybrid swordmage with the hybrid wizard gives you a great breadth of powers that share the same key ability.

If you're dedicated to staying in melee, consider adding the hybrid warlord, and put your Intelligence to good use as a tactician.

Although the hybrid swordmage and the hybrid shaman might seem incompatible, the spirit companion and the spirit's fangs power give a swordmage an extra option for battlefield control that doesn't require you to stay in the forefront every round. </specific>

You are no stranger to discipline and training, but you don't have the single-minded commitment to arcane swordplay that a swordmage has. Perhaps in your youth you dabbled in the fundamentals of spell and blade but never dedicated yourself to these studies wholeheartedly. Some hybrid swordmages are new students of ancient magical traditions, coming most often from other arcane or martial traditions.

As a hybrid swordmage, you provide a good mix of melee prowess, battlefield control, and utility, but you can't hold back waves of enemies quite as well as a full-fledged swordmage can.

Most hybrid rogues need two good ability scores, making hybrid combinations tricky to build.

A rogue/sorcerer can add some devious ranged and burst attacks to a repertoire of melee powers.

Combining the hybrid rogue with the hybrid bard creates a master trickster, who uses Charisma and Dexterity to alternately befuddle and eviscerate foes.

If you prefer brawn over guile, combine the hybrid fighter with the hybrid rogue, choose Rogue Tactics through the Hybrid Talent feat, and then pick either the Brutal Scoundrel class feature or the Ruthless Ruffian class feature. </specific>

You know the value of a well-placed knife, even if you don't bring the rogue's full complement of talents to every situation.
The most common backstory for a hybrid rogue is a childhood spent on the mean streets of a city, learning enough tricks to stay alive and out of prison. Alternatively, you might have been a respected member of society once, driven to a rogue's life by cruel fate or the machinations of your enemies. You can be just as sneaky and deadly as a nonhybrid rogue, but you must sacrifice some rogue options to gain those of another class.

Fighter/ranger is an effective combination if you focus on melee powers designed for two weapons.

A ranger/rogue is undoubtedly a master damage-dealer. However, when combining the ranger and rogue classes, choose your powers carefully; many of these powers have weapon requirements that don't match up well. For example, if you want to use ranged powers from both classes, you need a crossbow.

Even though the druid/ranger must balance multiple key abilities, this combination adds a fun primal flavor to the hybrid ranger. </specific>

Combining the hybrid fighter with the hybrid paladin keeps your AC up and mixes two different styles of melee control.

It's easy to see the value of combining paladin and cleric, but the paladin/warlord—favoring Charisma over Intelligence—might well be the most valiant battlefield leader imaginable.

Perhaps a strange combination, the paladin/warlock meshes melee prowess with deadly ranged attacks, as well as the ability to keep distant foes marked with divine challenge. For this combination, Paladin Armor Proficiency is a must-have option. </specific>

You combine the divine authority of a paladin with the talents of another class to become a formidable protector. Many hybrid paladins have only recently pledged themselves to the path of the divine warrior after years spent in other pursuits. A few, however, have recognized that single-minded devotion isn't for them and have expanded their abilities accordingly.

As a hybrid paladin, you bring a useful marking ability and strong melee powers to a group. Like other de-fenders, you are durable and can protect allies well, but you give up some healing capability to gain the tal-ents of another class.

A fighter/paladin draws on two different flavors of tenacity and resilience to create a single defender.

By adding hybrid warlord to hybrid fighter, you can dabble in either tactical genius or inspirational brilliance without giving up melee prowess.

If you're looking to add some nonmelee attacks to your hybrid fighter, consider the hybrid invoker. You don't give up much AC (particularly if you are going to wield a two-handed weapon), and it doesn't hurt for a fighter to have a high Wisdom score. </specific>

You call on your martial training to guard allies and strike down enemies, and because of your hybrid training, you have tricks up your sleeve that your enemies don't expect.

Many hybrid fighters learned their martial talents in a military or a mercenary organization, but these experiences typically represent only a portion of the character's background. Perhaps your character has moved on from military service to a new area of expertise, or maybe you have taken up the sword as part of a new direction in your life after months or years of other studies.

As a hybrid fighter, you protect your comrades as any other defender does: with durability, martial prowess, and battlefield control. However, you give up some of the fighter's talent with weapons, and you can't mark enemies with all your powers.

Cleric/fighter and cleric/paladin offer similar benefits: a great mix of Strength-based melee attacks, high durability, and healing powers to keep yourself and your allies in the fight.

A cleric/invoker stays at the back of the party, launching helpful ranged attacks and devastating area blasts from a position of relative safety.

A cleric/warlord combines leader powers from two different classes to make an effective whole. </specific>

By learning talents beyond those taught to the typical cleric, you have honed yourself into a distinctive divine leader. Your cleric training might represent a youthful devotion or a newly discovered dedication to a god.

As a hybrid cleric, you offer useful healing to a group, although less than a full-fledged cleric could. You also give up the versatility of the Channel Divinity and Ritual Casting class features in order to master new talents.
