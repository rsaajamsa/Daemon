    <specific name="Creating"> Crafting a unique companion character resembles creating a PC. To do so follow the steps outlined below:
     1. Choose Level: Set a companion character's level within one level of the PCs.
     2. Choose Role: A companion character doesn't have a character class, but each one does need a party role to generate numerical statistics and to clarify the character's place in the adventuring group.
	 3. Choose Race: If the companion character is a member of a PC race, he gains all the racial traits of that race including the racial power.
     4. Generate Ability Scores: Generate a unique companion character's ability scores just as you would for a 1st-level player character. Unlike with a PC or an NPC, a companion character's ability scores don't improve at higher levels.
     Ability modifiers don't influence a companion character's attack or defense numbers. Ability modifiers still apply when determining hit points and healing surges, damage values, skill check modifiers, ability check modifiers, and initiative check modifier.
     5. Determine Hit Points and Healing Surges: The role you assign to a companion character dictates his or her hit points and healing surges.
     6. Calculate Defenses: A companion character's defenses depend on the role and level you choose. Do not apply modifiers for ability scores or equipment.
     7. Select Powers: Choose a character class that has the same role as the companion character. Select one at-will attack power, one encounter attack power, and one utility power from that class. Each of these powers must be no higher in level than the companion character's level.
	 As the companion character gains levels, replace these powers with new powers of the companion character's level or lower. If the companion character is 11th level or higher, it gains an encounter attack power or utility power of 10th level or lower. If the companion character is 21st level or higher, it also gains an encounter attack power or utility power of 17th level or lower.
     8. Assign Feature: Each companion character also gains one of the following four features, as appropriate to his or her role.
     Controller: Once per encounter as a free action, a controller can extend an effect on an enemy to end at the end of his next turn, rather than his current turn.
     Defender: When a defender hits art enemy with a melee basic attack, the defender marks that target until the end of her next turn.
     Leader: Twice per encounter as a minor action, a leader can allow an ally within 5 squares of the leader to spend a healing surge. A leader of 16th level or higher can use this feature three times per encounter.
     Striker: Once per round, a striker deals 1d6 extra damage when he hits an enemy he has combat advantage against. This extra damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 21st level.
     9. Calculate Attack Bonus: A companion character's attack bonus equals 4 + level. For attacks with weapons, add the weapon's proficiency bonus. Do not apply modifiers for ability scores or magic items.
     10. Calculate Damage Bonus: A companion character adds the appropriate ability modifier to damage rolls as normal. In addition, the character adds one-half his or her level to all damage rolls. This value replaces the damage bonuses that PCs derive from feats and other special benefits.
     11. Choose Skills: Choose two trained skills for the companion character.
     At 11th level, and again at 21st level, companion characters gain a +3 bonus to each of their trained skills.
     12. Choose Equipment: Assign gear to the companion character as appropriate his or her their role, powers, and appearance.
     Armor and Shield: Even though the companion character's armor and shield do not modify his or her AC assign such gear as desired for the appropriate appearance. Apply any armor check and speed penalties.
     Weapons and Implements: Give the companion character weapons or implements appropriate for his or her powers. Remember to apply the weapon's proficiency bonus to attack rolls.
     Mundane Equipment: You can provide various mundane gear-rope, trail rations, torches, etc.
     Magic Items: Don't equip companion characters with magic items. A companion character doesn't need magic items to be a viable party member. A companion character's presence doesn't result in extra magic items placed as treasure.</specific>
    <specific name="Class Features"> Some of your most important characteristics are the ability to wear very good armor, your exceptional hit point total, and your mastery of all military weapons. In addition, you have three unique class features. </specific>

Defenders have the highest defenses in the game and good close-up offense. They are the party's front-line combantants; wherever they're standing, that's where the action is. Defenders have abilities and powers that make it difficult for enemies to move past them or to ignore them in battle.

You are a monster, fated and infected by a vile curse that transformed you into a creature of nightmare. Normal emotions have become alien to you. Only cold, gnawing hunger remains.
	Most of those who become vampires are victims of monstrous attacks, created by a callous hunter who drained them dry of blood and life force, then cast them aside. Others seek out this path from their own fear of infirmity and death, discovering the arcane rites and alchemical formulas that promise dark power. In some cases, a character finds his or her vampirism invoked by an ancient family curse, or that he or she is a member of an extended clan of vampires who pass their blood down to those they deem worthy—whether by choice or not.
	Whatever their origins, vampire characters are not slaves to their creators. Even those beholden to an older vampire retain free will, and have a chance to avoid sinking into the bestial depravity so common among their kind. Vampire characters are the most exceptional examples of those who carry this dark curse, using their powers not solely for murder and personal gain. Some become the greatest of heroes, but even those vampires are aware that few among the common folk have the ability to see past the frightening reality of their dark nature. Avoiding the scrutiny of superstitious folk and disguising his or her needs and abilities serves a vampire best. Trusted companions, enemies to slay and feast upon, and reasons to avoid civilized areas for extended times make an adventuring life the perfect choice for such characters.

Assassins embrace shadow magic and pledge a shard of their souls to the Shadowfell to gain their power. By replacing a fundamental part of themselves with a dark reflection, they can manifest that piece of shadow to accomplish incredible things. The infusion of shadow magic allows assassins to identify weak points in an opponent's defenses so that with a few moments of study they can reduce the stoutest enemies to corpses.
	An assassin usually keeps his or her profession a secret, since few trust those who regularly deal in death. Assassins's guilds provide some measure of protection, especially in those regions where the study of shadow magic and assassination as an art form are banned.
	As an assassin, you are an outcast. You traded away a part of your soul for the power of death, and only the most-loyal companions accept your skills into their midst. Whatever drew you onto the assassin's path, you become a trained killer from whom few can escape unharmed.

	An elementalist has the Elemental Magic  spell source as a class feature (which works like spell sources from Player's Handbook 2) and gains other class features related to an affinity for a particular element. Elementalists gain no encounter or daily attack powers from their class, but instead rely on at-will attack powers that have additional effects activated with the elemental escalation power. </specific>
    <specific name="Supplemental"> Ability Scores
Your elementalist sorcerer requires a superior Charisma score, since all your attacks are based on that ability. Constitution is a very important secondary score, contributing to your ability to channel dangerous bursts of elemental energy.
	Your other ability scores help to complete the portrait of your character and round out your talents. A good Dexterity or Intelligence makes sense as your third-best ability score, providing you with a solid Reflex defense. If you favor Dexterity, you might be a physically oriented elementalist who communes with the elements through rigorous physical exercises. If Intelligence is your choice, you could instead be an elemental sage, a student of the elemental planes and their denizens. </specific>

Disdaining the framework of theories of magic and sympathetic principles, elementalists seize the raw stuff of creation with simple force of will, bending the elements to their whim. Elementalist sorcerers might fashion whips or darts out of fire, create shields and armor from living rock, or inundate their enemies beneath torrents of water.
	Since elementalists arise from very different magic-using traditions, other users of arcane power shun them. These sorcerers practice their arts in isolated monasteries, secretive cabals, and occasionally elemental cults. Often accused of being more reckless and destructive than other kinds of sorcerers, elementalists in turn sneer at spellcasters who seek to create tools and systems for shaping magic at a safe distance. To elementalists, the only right way to wield magic is to dive in headlong and seize power with both hands. Some believe that elementalists are prone to evil or that they revel in reckless destruction, but neither assertion is necessarily true. Like more conventional arcane magic, the elementalist's magic is a tool—and like any tool, it can be turned to evil ends or to good.

The world experiences perpetual cycles of life, death, and rebirth. The four seasons are signposts that mark the world's progress through time, each with its own recognizable traits. The mortal races have learned to live in harmony with this cycle, using the bounty of spring, summer, and autumn to enable them to endure the desolation of winter. In you, that harmony manifests itself in a special way. You have learned to harness the greatest power of the natural world: that of primal magic.
     Druids are guardians of the world. They provide guidance to the common folk and tend to villages, towns, and vast stretches of unspoiled land in the same way that a gardener keeps watch over his flowers and vegetables. A druid works to ensure that the natural order remains strong. A wise druid allows a band of hunting goblins to gather food and game for their survival. But if those same goblins wreak havoc purely for the joy of destruction, the druid calls upon primal magic to smite and scatter them. As long as creatures live within the cycle of nature, a druid lives and lets live.
     Druids provide guidance and protection to farmers, wild animals, and plants in equal measure. In a druid's eyes, all living creatures have the same right to live within the world. A druid might help a village plant crops, but then turn against the villagers if they hunt to near extinction the wolves that prey on their cattle. Balance is the key to maintaining nature's integrity.

Though most people associate the Feywild with arcane magic, it is also home to some of the most pristine regions of natural growth across all of the planes. Primeval forests sit untouched by civilization since their creation, alongside mountainsides and hilltops upon which no intelligent being has ever set foot. It should be no surprise that there are those who have chosen a life of protection and guardianship over the natural treasures of the plane.
As with all druids, protectors are the masters of The magic first shared with mortals by the primal spirits. The primal spirits might dwell chiefly in the world, but the druids of the Feywild hear their call and heed their guidance even in the fey realm. Though it might seem as though the presence of the primal spirits in the Feywild would be at a diminished level, in truth primal magic is often among the most effective tools to use in a plane infused with arcane magic. Where many of the dangers of the Feywild have evolved over the eons to deal with the omnipresent nature of arcane threats, primal magic is still untamed and unanticipated by most creatures of the plane.
As a protector, you learned your primal magic from a druid circle, which trained you to protect nature and punish those that would do it harm. By ensuring that the land, the water, and the sky inhabited by ihe primal spirits is protected, you become a staunch defender of those who live in harmony with nature and show respect for their natural surroundings.
You might go out into the world to seek new experiences and powerful artifacts of primal magic. Though you will stray far from your druid circle in the course of your adventures, your efforts reflect on its goals, and you will use the knowledge it has granted you to battle despoilers and defilers throughout the world and across the planes.

Those who live on the fringes of civilization, or who come from places where civilization is nothing like what the mortal races understand, rely on chroniclers and historians who maintain their history as oral tradition. These individuals, respected for their knowledge and insights, serve as the keepers of the heritage of their people. It is their responsibility to make sure that none forget the past. They are both observers and storytellers; what they see becomes the legends and tales passed on from one generation to the next. These historians are known as skalds.
	A skald is no mere entertainer. Skalds are responsible for witnessing firsthand the great events of their time, committing those events to memory, and then passing on those tales. They learned all the tales of the previous generation as well, and theirs is a line of storytellers who pass on the entire history of their people. Skalds travel from one place to the next, acting as witnesses to the events of their time. Along the way they pick up new stories and bits of magic and other tricks that add to their mystique.
	Among the people of the world and other realms who know of this bardic tradition, skalds are nearly sacred. They can move freely through enemy territory and are considered untouchable even during the most bitter of tribal feuds. In many ways, skalds are like holy leaders: All but the most honorless thugs hesitate to attack them, and they are revered  and respected for their role as masters of history. When a culture's entire history is contained within the tales told by a single person, that person is more than just a storyteller; he or she is the sum total of that history, and that of all its ancestors, given flesh.
	In the Feywild, a skald is treated as a visiting dignitary, no matter where he or she comes from. From Cendriane to Mithrendain, even the most unmannered and barbaric skalds can find food, shelter, and respect throughout the lands of the eladrin. The Summer Queen herself would not refuse an audience with a skald, though most skalds know better than to bother powerful fey lords and ladies with trifling matters in such sessions. The status of a skald is perhaps even more elevated in the Feywild than it is in the mortal world, so that few in the  fey realm would risk being savaged in the stories of a skald, their names blackened for the rest of history because of an offense they committed against a storyteller.

On the edge of civilization, far beyond the comfortable life within cities and towns, tribes of barbarian peoples maintain a simple yet primitive existence. Life for these people is not easy, and it is made more difficult because fey crossings commonly appear in their lands. As children, tribe members are taught about the perils of crossing into the Feywild, and about the monsters that emerge from that realm with malicious intent. Faced with this constant danger, the barbarians continually fight to maintain their way of life.
	Some among them have fought so hard for so long that they know little other than violence as a means of protecting their tribes. These individuals, prone to rage that transforms them into whirling forces of destruction, are known as berserkers. Most berserkers are skilled warriors with keen survival instincts. When their ire is stoked, however, much of that experience and discipline is replaced by an animal fury unmatched among other warriors.
	If fury and aggressiveness was all that berserkers had to protect them from harm, they would eventually tire and be overcome by their enemies. When the berserkers' unbridled rage overtakes them, they become beacons of the spirit world, and their rage sounds like a gong calling to the primal spirits. Those spirits are drawn to such strong emotion, and are able to inhabit berserkers during their rages, protecting them against harm. The spirits also lend their energy to the berserkers, allowing them to perform incredible, even supernatural, feats.
	It is not just barbarians in the mortal world who become berserkers. Within the Feywild are many savage warriors, and that bright realm is a place where warriors who are as mercurial as the berserker fit right in. Many berserkers are found among the lycanthrope tribes of the Brokenstone Vale, others are among the elves who still dwell in the forests of the Feywild, and yet others can be found anywhere civilization has not yet encroached upon.

A mage is a specialized wizard, a spellcaster who focuses on the tenets of a particular school of magic. This specialization makes each mage distinctive. After all, a mage who casts evocation spells presents a very different picture to the world from a mage who has mastered the art of illusion or enchantment.
	Mages tend to approach arcane magic with a more scholarly bent than other wizards, and that's saying a lot. Don't expect to find adventuring mages hidden away in dusty towers, however. They hit the ground running, ready to explore every dungeon and ancient ruin in search of lore and knowledge that will increase their understanding of everything arcane-and thereby increase their personal power.
	The ancient traditions of the schools have been handed down since the first mortals began to dabble in arcane magic. What started as techniques and methods of training between masters and apprentices eventually became more institutionalized, and eventually actual academies of arcane study sprang up in the world and even among the eladrin of the Feywild. In time, single towers devoted to a single arcane discipline gave way to grand academies where illusion magic was taught alongside evocation magic.
	Today, where and how arcane magic is taught depends on where you happen to be. On the borderlands, in places such as Fallcrest, solitary mages pass on their knowledge to one or two apprentices at a time. In larger settlements, such as the city of Nera, academies are dedicated to the training of mages in all of the schools of magic.

Those who see a bladesinger in battle never forget the sight. Amid the chaos and blood, the bladesinger moves in an otherworldly dance. Spells and sword act as partners, matching awe-inspiring beauty with an awful deadliness. When the bladesinger engages in the true heart of the art, when the sword whirls through the air so swiftly that it keens and the air hums and whistles in chorus, when the bladesong has begun—then the bladesinger becomes something unreal, something timeless.
	According to legend, Corellon himself inspired and taught the first bladesinger. The techniques handed down as a gift from the leader of the elven deities have passed from one to another among the Tel'Quessir for untold generations, and though different styles evolved as eladrin and elves turned its power to suit their needs, none have improved upon the essential core of the art.
	The bladesinger wields a weapon one-handed, leaving the other free or using it to employ a wand that can be incorporated into the fighting style. This technique gives a bladesinger the speed and freedom of movement necessary for the dancelike motions of the various forms of martial art, which allow for both magical and physical attacks to flow freely.
	Few among the Tel'Quessir have the honor of being inducted into the bladesingers. One must have the mind necessary to be a great wizard, and also the agility of the greatest dancer. Yet those traits alone are not enough. A bladesinger is first and foremost devoted to the ways and the people of the Tel'Quessir, for that was the purpose of Corellon's gift.
	A bladesinger who has set out beyond the borders of a nation of the People must have had good cause. Adventuring bladesingers might seek out relics or locations of great meaning to the Tel'Quessir, or they could leave in order to guard a specific person or group against harm. A bladesinger might instead embark upon a quest to eliminate a threat to the People or to find and communicate with some long-lost branch of the race. In a more tragic case, a bladesinger might have failed in the duty to protect a community and be death-pledged to avenge it and restore his or her honor.

Part religion, part ritual, and all mystery, witchcraft is an ancient practice that came about in an age before arcane magic was studied, institutionalized, and etched in writing, when monstrous titans ruled over creation and the secret of making fire was yet undiscovered. In this chaotic dark age, the gods had little influence on the titans' world. Instead of seeking their aid, the primitive peoples called out to the night for protection and power, and a voice from the darkness answered. Those who accepted its arcane gifts became the first witches, and they wielded such power as only immortals had known-seen by some jealous gods as an affront that they have never forgiven.
	Witches gain their power from a patron who instructs them by way of a mystical familiar that comes and goes as it pleases, unbound by the strictures of the material world. The most prevalent patron among witches-the original voice from the darkness-is the moon goddess Sehanine, referred to by witches as simply the Goddess. Other entities have since seen the advantage of imbuing mortals with power, and so your patron might be an archfey, a god, an angel, a primordial, a demon lord, a devil, or another legendary being that believes it can benefit by imbuing you with a gift of arcane prowess. It might prefer to remain anonymous.
	The circumstances by which you obtained your gift can vary widely. Some witches seek out the gift in order to fulfill a personal desire or vendetta, while others were brought up in a coven. Some receive their power after making a pact with a devil, as a warlock might do, and others have it bestowed upon them by a fairy godparent or a witch queen.
	Though witches are common among the fey races in the Feywild, as a witch in the natural world you must be mindful of whom you trust. In the world, common folk fear your kind. Envious wizards refuse to acknowledge you as a peer and would see your wondrous powers vanish from the world, while clerics of jealous gods decree you an unholy menace, sending witch hunters to track you down and destroy you.

Sha'irs cull magical energy from the Elemental Chaos to power their spells. Rather than pore over ancient formulas and techniques, these wizards bargain with elemental powers for the magical knowledge they need. Sha'irs do not deal directly with these powers; instead, they rely on proxies, elemental spirits called gen servants, to negotiate on their behalf. Dispatching these servants to the Elemental Chaos each day, a sha'ir replenishes the necessary power and information to wield the forces of creation.
	Their unconventional methods, combined with their reputation for consorting with dangerous, often violent, powers, place sha'irs on the fringes of the magical world. Other wizards regard sha'irs with scorn and distrust, believing that they cheat by circumventing the arduous training and research wizards must typically undergo. This mistrust stems from ignorance, however, for even though a sha'ir draws magic from a gen servant, a foundation in arcane training is necessary to wield the power he or she gains.
	Since sha'irs do not clutter their minds with mystical formulas and arcane utterances, they have wider access to spells than other wizards enjoy. They need only know a spell's basic structure to request it from their gen servants. The gen servant then vanishes into the Elemental Chaos, where it bargains with more powerful elemental lords and creatures to acquire the spell the sha'ir seeks and then returns without fail to provide its master with the energy and means to cast the spell. So even though sha'irs do not employ spellbooks, they have access to the full expanse of wizards' most powerful and versatile spells.
	The elemental powers that lend magical knowledge and energy to sha'irs do not do so without an expectation of recompense. Sha'irs often take up the adventurer's life for this reason. They work in the world and beyond as representatives, agents, and servants of their elemental masters. Many times a sha'ir does not even realize that his or her actions are furthering some elemental being's designs, and what might seem to be a normal expedition into the unknown could have consequences not realized for years to come.

Most people believe that the path to arcane power traces its way through dusty libraries, impenetrable tomes of lore, and countless hours of practice and study. What little the common folk understand about wizards revolves around their scholarly pursuits. Warlocks, however, know about different paths to power. The labyrinthine rules and theories of arcane magic are by no means complete. In some places, the laws of magic are vague, twisted, or subject to the whims of powerful entities. Warlocks enter into pacts with these entities, pledging their service and their souls in return for access to spells. With a word of promise, warlocks gain great power, but rarely do they have the wisdom and foresight needed to wield such power.
     A warlock gains this power with little practice or focus. One need only learn the rituals needed to contact a planar entity in order to gain a warlock's power. Most warlocks face suspicion and mistrust from the common people, because all too often those who embrace this path do so in search of a quick, easy way to gain power over others. Yet for every warlock who enters a pact for selfish reasons, there is one who turned to it as a last resort against a mad tyrant or a rampaging horde of monsters.
     Warlocks rarely congregate in large groups. They easily accept members of other classes as allies, but there are few if any guilds, schools, or other organizations to bind them. The typical warlock enters into a pact and perfects its magic alone. Aside from the rituals used to create pacts, little formal research or study is involved in the warlock's art.
     Hexblades are warlocks who learn to shape the arcane energy of their pacts into deadly weapons, such as a sword forged from infernal power or a slender blade that gleams with fey magic. Both a warrior and an arcanist, a hexblade uses a deadly combination of spells and fighting ability during combat.	
     Few people trust hexblades. Although most common folk are at best suspicious of wizards, the typical mage isolates himself or herself while engaging in arcane study, rarely exposing the populace to deadly magic. Hexblades come by their power through an easier, and more easily mistrusted, path. Some of the greatest villains to plague the land have been hexblades. After stumbling across the rituals and incantations needed to contact and forge a bargain with a mighty entity, a marauding bandit or a bloodthirsty ore chieftain could become a hexblade. The entities that would grant power to hexblades care little for how such a gift is used. Their interest is focused on the souls and the powder provided to them by those to whom they give power through a pact. And such evil hexblades don't isolate themselves in the wild, but instead take what they want from those less powerful.	
     Those few hexblades who prefer to be honorable face suspicion and persecution from a variety of quarters, because their magic is misunderstood and typically wielded by villains. Even though these hexblades choose to do good, most are forced to the shadows by suspicion and fear from common folk, and they must strike at evil in secret, working behind the scenes to keep the fragile structure of civilization intact.

Warlocks manipulate arcane power, as wizards do, but their conduit to that power is vastly different. For a warlock, it's as much about who you know as what you know—and in effect, the two are the same.
	All warlocks gain access to their power by entering into a pact with some force or entity in which that power rests. In return for their continuing loyalty and service to the source of their power, warlocks become more adept at their craft, and the abilities they bring to the battlefield grow more lethal.
	The type of warlock you can create with this book is the binder.

A thief specializes in agility and trickery, using hard-earned skills to pilfer and hide, escape from tight situations, and overcome deadly traps. A thief has powerful combat abilities, but relies first and foremost on circumventing an enemy's defenses through acrobatics and stealth. Brute strength and arcane power have their uses, but a thief 's quick reflexes and agile touch can get the drop on enemies before they know what hit them.
	Most thief adventurers are explorers and treasure hunters, keen on delving into long-forgotten ruins in the hope of finding valuable lore, treasure, or magic. Many thieves learn their skills on the streets or as unapologetic criminals. However, such characters often develop noble intentions, choosing to steal only from the wealthy or from those in need of being taught a lesson. After all, sometimes bad guys make the best good guys.

Hunters are the masters of ranged weapons, and they draw on cunning battle tactics to deter their enemies. Reverent allies of the natural world, hunters train in the deep forests and wilderness, tracking down and slaying monsters intent on attacking villages and towns. At the same time, they seek to find harmony with the beneficial creatures of nature, and they learn to dabble in primal power-the magic of nature itself.
     A hunter is a controller first and foremost, manipulating the battlefield using high-precision ranged attacks. Against single targets, however, a hunter's attacks pack a punch that make it lean toward striker as a secondary role.

Scouts learn to wield two weapons at once, from the supple combination of longsword and short sword to the brutal double assault of battleaxe and handaxe. This tactic denies the defensive benefit of a shield, but allows a scout to strike hard and fast. At their best when outnumbered and surrounded, scouts count on speed and accuracy in combat to overwhelm their foes.
     Scouts augment their combat prowess with primal magic, channeling the supernatural power of the natural world to their advantage. Primal power allows a scout to pass by foes unseen, to discourage pursuit, and to keep his or her companions alive in the wild under conditions that would slay lesser explorers outright.

Some warriors fight for gold. Others seek glory, power, or prestige. There are a few, however, who seek the warrior's path for reasons that transcend the material and mundane. Called by divine powers to stand as champions of the light against the ever-encroaching darkness, paladins fight not because they choose to, but because, deep within their souls, they know they must. The paladin's life is not a choice. It is a destiny.
     Paladins are holy warriors, defenders of good and enemies of evil. Paladins are well trained with their weapons and armor, but they augment that skill with divine powers that allow them to shield their allies and smite their enemies. A single paladin can turn the tide of an entire war through a combination of skill at arms and inspiring leadership. As icons of virtue and heroism, paladins are a deadly threat to those who would rule through fear, intimidation, and violence.
     Paladins typically wander the land either alone or in small groups. They seek out wrongs to right and villainy to defeat. Most paladins begin as squires to more experienced holy warriors. Through training and arduous tests, a squire's bravery, battle skill, and ethics are all tested to see if the squire is worthy of becoming a paladin.
     A cavalier is a paladin who has embraced one of the heroic virtues, such as compassion, justice, sacrifice, or valor. His or her belief in this virtue is so strong that it manifests as divine magic. Although many cavaliers pledge their faith to the gods, others follow no specific religion. Regardless of one's divine affiliation (or lack thereof), a cavalier's virtue stands paramount. It guides his or her actions, pointing to the best way to protect the ever-flickering light of hope and civilization in the world.
	 Opposing the cavaliers and the virtues that they champion are the blackguards, who embody the dreaded vices that the cavaliers stand against. Where cavaliers embrace compassion, justice, sacrifice, and valor, blackguards epitomize fury, tyranny, greed, and terror. Since the earliest days of history, these two factions have fought each other. Both wander the land, gathering allies and working to further the cause of their virtues or vices.
     At one time, cavaliers formed into chivalrous orders that were dedicated to the ideal of protecting the civilized realms. The forgotten kingdoms that ruled the land relied on cavaliers to help keep the peace. Those cavaliers maintained not only the military security of the land, but also its moral strength. A cavalier might drive off a marauding troll, but she could also mediate a dispute between two farmers, break the power of a corrupt noble, or free a wrongly accused prisoner.
     As with many things from the time of the forgotten kingdoms, the cavaliers' glory proved fleeting. The kingdoms of old grew weak, and some of their decline could be laid at the feet of cavaliers who strayed from the righteous path. All too often, cavaliers fell victim to the very evils they had sworn to combat. Power corrupts, and in many cases cavaliers served as perfect examples of how power can twist the most resolute heart.
     The grand orders of cavaliers have long since faded, but their glory is not forgotten. Even as evil casts its shadow across the land, there are those who hear the call to the cavalier's path. Many of the cavaliers of old strayed from their purpose, but that purpose and the power behind it remains strong for those who stay true to it.

Such virtuous figures are symbols to the common people, icons from which they draw the strength and courage to stand fast against the encroaching darkness. Yet in every light a shadow lurks—the brightness of these noble warriors is equaled by the shadow spreading from their sinister counterparts.

Along the borderlands, knights are the stalwart commanders of peasant militias, caravan guards, and adventuring groups. Their cunning and skill puts them in control of the battlefield and lets them minimize the onslaught of their enemies. Rampaging monsters fear a knight above almost any other attacker. While the knight locks down a formidable foe, the other members of a party close in for the kill.
	Many knights are members of chivalrous orders, though some are independent warriors who wander wherever their hearts take them. Each order combines a rigid sense of honor and relentless training to produce  champions of the borderlands. Whenever ogres descend from the hills, when hobgoblins march from their strongholds, and when necromancers call forth armies of undead, a noble knight is the best defense an isolated community can hope for.
	All sorts of warriors follow the path of the knight: young wanderers seeking to prove their mettle and gain full membership into a knightly order, reclusive warriors who abandon material comforts in favor of crusades for justice, or self-centered mercenaries who hope to claim treasure and power after every fight.
	Most knights start as squires, training with orders that have heroic and historic names such as the Knights of the Watch or the Order of the Silver Dragon. Through study, martial practice, and adventuring, a squire earns the right to wear armor and bear the weapons of a knight. Orders maintain small keeps on the borderlands, from which they send out patrols, enforce the law, and repel monstrous incursions.

When tales are told of the most legendary warriors, slayers are the heroes those stories speak of. Slayers are elite shock troops, standing at the forefront of battle with a combination of strong armor, advanced tactical cunning, and a mastery of withering two-handed weapon attacks.
	On the borderlands of civilization, the common folk are beset on all sides by a multitude of foes. Goblin invaders can outnumber a town's defenders five to one, and powerful giants and trolls can easily shrug off a spear thrust or a crossbow bolt. The slayer is trained to correct this imbalance. By pairing the heaviest melee weapons with fearless combat tactics, a slayer can score deadly blows against larger enemies or hew through mobs of lesser foes.
	Slayers come from all backgrounds and societies. Some are warriors with only the most basic training, relying on raw fury and instinct to overwhelm their enemies. Others might be former soldiers whose homes have been destroyed like so many others on the borderlands, and who have sworn to use their martial skills for vengeance.
	The slayer combines the best traits of a defender and a striker, with superior defenses backed by devastating weapon attacks. This class grants heavy armor proficiency and plenty of hit points, making a slayer the ideal warrior to stand at the front line of battle.

Warpriests use a combination of religious dedication and keen insight to access the divine magic granted by the gods they serve. Using that magic to back up impressive martial ability, warpriests serve as the shield of their faith. Warpriests protect the innocent from marauding monsters and lead adventuring expeditions into the dark unknown. They are drawn to the borderlands between the scattered settlements of civilization and the realms of chaos. There, they attend the spiritual and military needs of the population.
	Warpriests occupy the middle ground between the wizard and the fighter. They are trained to use weapons and armor, but it is their induction into the mysteries of divine magic that makes them unique. A warpriest can smash an orc with a mace one moment and unleash divine power to smite a vampire the next. The power of weapons and the might of magic meet in the divine mandate of the warpriest.

Like the multiclass feats introduced in the Player's Handbook, these rules let you reflect a more varied array of character abilities than traditional classes do. Whether you're doing this to reflect your character's elaborate backstory, to combine different mechanical elements to create a potent new combination, or to fill out a group that needs just a little something extra, the end result is the same: Your hybrid character gives up depth of ability in exchange for greater flexibility.

Characteristics: You use melee attacks to harass your enemies and leave them vulnerable to your allies' attacks. With your heavy armor and your ability to heal, you are ideally suited for standing on the front line.

Religion: Runepriests are found among the followers of all the gods, but they most commonly worship Corellon, Erathis, Ioun, or Moradin. Moradin is a patron of smiths and other artisans who seek to master a craft. Many runepriests create fine goods as they practice their ability to forge runes. Corellon attracts runepriests who view the inscribing of runes as an art. Ioun values the protective aspects of rune magic and the knowledge contained in the runes. Erathis favors inventors and others who seek knowledge, a perfect match for runepriests who seek to uncover or create new runes.

Races: Deva runepriests favor the way of the Defiant Word and create beautiful illuminated manuscripts of religious lore, building libraries that grow for generations in hidden corners of the Astral Sea. Elf runepriests also embrace this path, tending trees and other plants to grow in runic patterns to honor the gods. Dwarves, minotaurs, and goliaths commonly follow the path of the Wrathful Hammer. In great caverns, divine runes decorate dwarven chapels as well as secluded minotaur shrines. Goliath runepriests carve massive runes atop their holy peaks, marking the territory as warded by the gods and serving as landmarks for their people as they migrate from one mountain to the next. </specific>

Isolated in sacred forges and holy libraries, runepriests seek to unlock the secrets of the runes of divine power. Legend holds that the gods crafted a set of powerful runes, each imbued with a core of divine power, to help create the world and give it order. During the long war against the primordials, many of these runes were lost. Even the gods only dimly recall the runes of power. Somewhere in the forgotten depths of a dungeon or the isolated corner of the planes, those ancient runes wait to be discovered. A runepriest can learn much in the peaceful halls of a temple, but sooner or later he or she must put on armor and go forth to find or create a new rune, and in so doing earn a name among the masters of rune magic.

You learned the art of rune smithing from your master. Perhaps you sweated over a forge deep within a dwarven stronghold, crafting weapons and armor for the faithful as part of your apprenticeship. Or you might have helped inscribe runes in the living wood of the forest, crafting signs to warn of approaching enemies. Along the way, you learned how to take inscribed runes and turn them into words and signs of power that you can incorporate into your prayers. But now, the time for learning is at an end. Now is the time for adventure.

Merge the runes of power with your weapons and armor. Call to the gods and channel their might against your enemies. The runes are your weapons, and the gods' foes await your judgment.

Those who let their base emotions rule them invite madness and destruction. Prolonged feelings of fear, greed, lust, or hatred can weaken the mind's defenses against manipulation. Wielding psionic power, you excite such emotions in your enemies, creating gaps in their defenses and frustrating their attacks, all while filling your allies with encouraging thoughts and guarding them against despair and other negative emotions.

Ardents rarely learn their art through formal training. In many ways, they are incidental leaders, having stumbled onto psionic power at some point earlier in their lives. How you discovered your psionic talent can shape how you wield this power now. You might have awakened to your talent in the heat of battle, experiencing a mental breakthrough that allowed you to augment your attacks by rending your enemies' minds. Or your friends might reflect your power when your mood bleeds into theirs, altering their emotional states to match your own. Regardless of the revelation, you learned to harness this power to support your fighting prowess and to guide your allies to victory.

Characteristics: Your arrows or thrown weapons loose primal power when used. They might manifest as primal spirits hungering for revenge or as icy winds or crackling lightning. Your powers control your enemies, interfering with their movement, holding them in place, or injuring them for their actions. Also, your attacks might call forth spirits to worry your enemies and pursue them across the battlefield.

Religion: Like other primal characters, seekers view the world's primal spirits as kindred and partners, and they venerate them more than they worship the gods. Seekers who do follow deities commonly worship Melora for her dominion over the forces of nature, Corellon (who is sometimes depicted as the founder of archery), Kord, or Sehanine. Evil seekers sometimes follow Gruumsh or Zehir.

Races: Elves and shifters are the most common seekers, since both their natural inclinations toward primal paths and their inherent abilities make them well matched with the capabilities of the class. Goliaths who favor ranged combat sometimes become seekers (preferring thrown weapons over bows or crossbows), and wilden seekers are also fairly common. </specific>

Seekers are primal champions who scour the wilderness in search of those who would defile it. Versed in hunting techniques handed down through the generations, seekers combine thrown weapon and bow techniques with primal evocations. The combination allows seekers great range in which to deliver deadly attacks that confound and hamper their enemies. When a seeker looses a missile, the primal spirits bound to it through ancient evocations are freed, sometimes as terrifying beasts and sometimes as nature's raw destructive potential.

As a seeker, you are both a hunter and a mystic. You attune yourself to the wilderness you call your home, but you are equally tied to the spirits that dwell in the world around you. With your people's traditions and whispered advice from the spirits, you navigate the wilds with ease, at home as any beast. If an enemy appears, you have nothing to fear, both because you have mastered your weapons and because the spirits to whom you have bound yourself add their savage might to your attacks. Whether you use lightning strikes, grasping vines, or spectral beasts, your enemies cannot stand against your assault.

    <specific name="Supplemental"> Assassin Overview

Characteristics: You can turn into an insubstantial creature of shadow. While you are in that form, even the most alert sentinel can overlook your approach, and attacks pass through you with little harm. When you spot your target, you study its weaknesses as you prepare to deliver a killing blow.

Religion: Assassins who pursue evil creatures are often worshipers of the Raven Queen, who teaches that death is the great leveler, a tool the world needs to end abuses by powerful beings. Evil assassins wallow in the misery and fear they cause, or they revel in performing an exquisite kill. Such folk usually venerate Zehir or Lolth.

Races: Revenants have the combination of implacability and physical ability needed to flourish as assassins. Half-orcs also excel as assassins, often having a brutish nature that makes the assassin's art palatable to them. Drow are superlative assassins, both because they grow up in a society that values skilled murder and because they are comfortable with working in darkness. Halflings make good assassins since they can combine their natural stealthiness with a native curiosity that makes hiding from them difficult. Changeling assassins possess an unsurpassed ability to infiltrate and kill from a position of trust.

Assassins and the Ki Focus
Assassins use ki focuses for the ability to augment mundane weapons. After all, a guard patrol is far more suspicious of the wanderer carrying a greatsword than of the unarmed peasant. Using ki focuses, assassins wield whatever weapons are at hand, or even unarmed strikes, to deliver shadow attacks.

When you use your ki focus with a weapon attack, you focus shadow magic into your weapon. Some assassins carry a few different weapons to ensure that they have the right tool for the job. An accurate weapon, such as a longsword, is a good tool for taking down a heavily armored warrior. When an assassin battles a brute that relies on endurance rather than defense, a less accurate but devastating weapon such as a greataxe proves useful.
	
Since your ki focus augments your basic attacks, a thrown weapon wielded in your off hand serves as the perfect complement to your primary weapon. You can throw a dagger to cut down a fleeing guard, and feats such as Two-Weapon Fighting improve your melee abilities. </specific>
    <specific name="Implement"> Assassins focus their shadow energy through a ki focus, which is not an object they wield but a reservoir of magical power within themselves. When using a ki focus, an assassin taps into the power of shadow magic and channels it into both implement and weapon attacks.

You can imbue your ki focus with magic as if it were a physical implement. When you have a magic ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of assassin powers and assassin paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. You can also add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of any weapon attack you make using a weapon with which you're proficient.

You can also use a weapon with which you're proficient as an implement. While wielding the weapon as an implement, the characteristics of the weapon you use—proficiency bonus, damage die, and weapon properties (such as defensive or high crit)—are irrelevant to your implement powers.

If you have a magic ki focus and wield a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of your ki focus or to employ the magic of your weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to attacks with that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the property of your magic weapon with the same attack power. </specific>
    <specific name="Powers"> Your powers are called hexes. They draw on your shadowed soul to enhance your combat techniques or harm your enemies directly. You can use shadows as distractions, weapons, and secret paths to destroy your enemies. </specific>

Few creatures embrace shadow magic without both a compelling reason and a measure of desperation. Not many visit the Shadowfell willingly, let alone pledge a shard of their souls to it. Yet that is exactly what assassins, and other practitioners of shadow magic, do to gain their power.

As an assassin, you cede a portion of yourself to the Shadowfell, replacing a fundamental part of your being with a dark reflection of your true self. At times, you can manifest this twisted image in place of your body so that you can face attacks with little cause for concern. Also, the infusion of shadow magic allows you to spot the weakest points in a victim's defenses. With a few moments of study, you can reduce even the stoutest warrior to a corpse.

If others know that you are an assassin, you might find that few trust you. In some civilized realms, the study of shadow magic and assassination is banned on pain of death. In the past, and as a response to the outcry against them, assassins formed coteries, or guilds, of like-minded slayers, and each one delves into the study of shadow magic and develops unique methods of killing. A guild provides you with a measure of protection, and its grandmasters expect obedience and fealty. The wars between guilds, and the struggles within them, might never spill into mass battles, but they still leave dozens of slain folk in their wake.

As an assassin, you are an outcast. You traded away part of your soul for the power of death. Perhaps you seek justice against a powerful enemy, or maybe you had no other way to preserve yourself in the face of a bleak, uncaring world. Whatever drew you onto the assassin's path, you are an avatar of death and a trained killer from whom few can escape unharmed.

Psions are the quintessential manipulators of psionic power. Psions unleash the potential locked within every conscious mind, move objects with just a thought, and assume command of even the least desire of their foes. Psions make manifest their secret wishes when others can only dream.

Depending on your Monastic Tradition, you might favor Wisdom or Strength as your second ability score. </specific>
    <specific name="Class Features" />
    <specific name="Supplemental"> Full Discipline
Many monk powers have the full discipline keyword. A full discipline power gives you two or more actions to choose from, usually an attack technique and a movement technique. Attack techniques usually require a standard action, and movement techniques are options for your move actions. For a monk, a full discipline power represents a fighting style, a unique combination of a move and an attack.
You can use only one full discipline power per round. However, if you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can switch to a different full discipline power. You can use the techniques of a full discipline power in whatever order you like, and you can choose to use one of the techniques and not the other during a particular round.
The number of times you can use a full discipline power's techniques during a round is determined by the power's type—at-will or encounter—and by the actions you have available that round. For example, you can use the techniques of an at-will full discipline power as many times during a round as you like, provided you have enough of the required actions, but you can use the techniques of an encounter full discipline power once during a round. </specific>
    <specific name="Implement"> Monks usually channel their psionic energy through an item called a ki focus, which is a wooden practice weapon, prayer beads, a manual of lore, or some other object a monk studies or uses during training or meditation. After you attune yourself to a ki focus, you can use it as an implement when it is on your person (see the “Ki Focuses” sidebar).

When you wear or hold your ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of monk powers and monk paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. You can also add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of weapon attacks you make using a weapon with which you're proficient.

You can also use a weapon with which you're proficient as an implement. When wielding the weapon as an implement, the weapon's characteristics—proficiency bonus, damage die, and weapon properties like defensive or high crit—are irrelevant to your implement powers.

If you have both a magic ki focus and a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of the ki focus or the weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the critical hit effect of your magic weapon with the same attack. </specific>

From high in forbidding mountains to the alleys of a city's meanest district, the ascetic warriors known as monks practice their art. By focusing on their minds and bodies, honing both to near perfection, they master a psionic fighting art that allows them to deliver a punch with the force of a giant's club and to absorb attacks as easily as a heavily armored knight. Monks tap into the psionic potential that rests within themselves, turning that energy further inward to fortify their bodies and sharpen their minds.

Perhaps you set out on this path to put a dark past behind you. Or your village was victimized one time too many by an evil lord or marauding beasts, and you now seek justice. No matter what your motivation, the path of the monk transforms you into a living weapon.

The road opens wide before you. With little more than a walking stick and perhaps a satchel of food, you are ready to take on whatever the world can throw at you. Your years of training taught you to turn your eye inward. Now it is time to look outward and test yourself against the world's dangers.

Barbarians are savage warriors who deal out powerful blows from their mighty weapons. They charge from foe to foe and seldom feel the pain of an enemy's strike. For barbarians' foes, the moments of greatest terror come when barbarians call upon primal forces to lend power to their raging spirits. These rages, although temporary, give a barbarian incredible powers, a combination of skill, willpower, and a legacy of ancient tribal rituals.
As a barbarian, you have a link to powerful nature spirits and other primal forces bound to the warriors of your tribe by the songs and totems of your legacy. These spirits lend energy to your rages, transforming you into a devastating force on the battlefield. As you become more experienced, these rages transcend mortal limitations, manifesting directly as waves of elemental power or gifting you with supernatural recuperative powers.
When the heat of battle is upon you, will you respond with a sudden charge that fells with one mighty swing of your weapon, or with a prolonged rage that leaves destroyed foes in your wake?

You lead your adventuring party from a position of relative safety, sending your spirit companion to the front of the battle while you linger behind. Your powers fall into two broad categories: melee attacks your spirit companion makes, and ranged attacks. Your daily powers include a number of conjurations and zones, representing your ability to call on additional spirits for aid.

Religion
Shamans draw their power from the primal power source and therefore don't usually worship gods. They view themselves as agents—not servants or masters—of the spirits of nature and instruct others how to live their lives in harmony with those spirits. Like druids, shamans call on the spirits to witness significant events but don't worship them. </specific>
    <specific name="Implement"> Shamans use totems carved to resemble the spirits they most commonly call upon, particularly their spirit companions. When you wield a magic totem, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of shaman powers and shaman paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers. </specific>
    <specific name="Powers"> Your powers evoke primal spirits that you view as partners and revered elders. Many of your powers channel primal energy through your spirit companion and have the spirit keyword, including powers that have “spirit” as part of the range. Those powers treat your spirit companion's space as the origin square for the power, so “melee spirit 1” means you can target a creature adjacent to your spirit.
Other shaman powers call on other spirits to intervene in the course of battle on your behalf, and many of those spirits then channel their energy through your spirit companion either to benefit allies or to harm enemies. </specific>

Shamans are inspiring and dangerous battle leaders. They command powerful spirit guides, and through them lead their allies. These nature spirits bolster their allies' attacks and offer protection and healing when needed.
In a rite of passage or initiation, you pledged yourself to the spirits, to be their voice and hands in the world. Through ancient song and sacred ceremony, you have called a powerful spirit companion to your side. The primal spirits of nature affirm your will, guide the actions of your allies, and deal mighty attacks against your foes. You might be a venerable advisor to a tribal leader, a young traveler seeking to bring tales of a wider world back to your people, or a scholar devoted to the pursuit of nearly forgotten lore.
The spirits and voices of nature guide your every step. Their power flows through you, calling you to lead, to fight, and to triumph.

As mountains stand fast against the buffeting wind and trees bend but do not break in the storm, wardens are stalwart protectors who draw on the primal spirits of nature to defend the natural world from those who would corrupt or destroy it. Some wardens use the power of earth and stone to shield their allies from harm, whereas others summon the primal strength within themselves to increase their ferocity and tenacity.
As a warden, you might be the staunch defender of a tribe, chosen by the spirits to be your people's champion. Perhaps you were visited by spirits at a sacred grove and charged with protecting it against a spreading corruption. You might have been raised by a bear or nurtured by dryads, chosen from infancy to stand fast against nature's enemies.
Primal power waits in the ground beneath your feet, surges with every beat of your heart, and flows through your lungs with every breath. The world cries out to you, calling for a champion to defend it. Will you heed its call?

Swinging a melee weapon in combat, you wield devastating divine power against your foes. You have a secondary assortment of ranged and close implement powers that let you draw your foes closer to you, teleport near them, or scorch them with divine wrath from afar.

Religion
An avenger might serve any deity, but an avenger is more likely to worship an unaligned deity than a god of good or lawful good. Avengers of Ioun are among the most common, fighting a war of knowledge against the servants of Vecna. Unaligned avengers often revere the Raven Queen, Erathis, or Sehanine, and evil avengers often serve Asmodeus, Lolth, Tiamat, or Zehir.

Races
Elves and razorclaw shifters make excellent pursuing avengers, and devas excel as isolating avengers. Many avengers are human, because most of the hidden monasteries that produce avengers are of human origin. </specific>
    <specific name="Implement"> Like clerics and paladins, avengers use holy symbols to help channel and direct their divine powers.

In secret temples far from bustling cities and priestly hierarchies, orders of esoteric warriors train their initiates in ancient traditions now forgotten or forbidden by most religious organizations. The champions of these orders are avengers—deadly weapons in the hands of their gods, imbued with divine power through secret rites of initiation. In battle, avengers swear to execute divine vengeance, entering a mental state that gives them unerring focus on a single enemy.

As an avenger, you were trained in a monastery, initiated through secret rites, and imbued with the power to smite your god's foes. You might be a disciple of Ioun, sworn to hunt and exterminate the minions of Vecna until you one day face the Maimed God. You could be an agent of the Raven Queen, bringing death to those who would defy your mistress. Or perhaps you serve Bahamut as an agent of justice, bringing ruin to tyrants and oppressors. The organizations devoted to your god might view you as a heretic or a hero, but you answer only to your god and to the vows you swore upon your initiation as an avenger.

Where will those vows lead you? One thing is certain: Doing the will of your god is never easy and never free of peril.

The sorcerer is the arcane antithesis of the wizard. Wielding raw, barely contained magical power, sorcerers channel bursts and blasts of arcane energy through their bodies. They gain their power not through rigorous study of esoteric tomes, but by harnessing magic in their blood, waiting to be tapped and shaped. If wizards wield magic as fighters wield swords, a sorcerer's magic is the arcing greataxe of a raging barbarian.
You might be a proud dragonborn scion of ancient Arkhosia, calling on the draconic power of your heritage, or perhaps you were bathed in dragon blood as an infant to fill you with that power. You might have been born in a place where planar forces converged in strange eddies, infusing you with chaos, or perhaps you survived implantation of a slaad embryo, which left the taint of chaos upon you.
Magic pulses through your veins, calling on you to give it expression. As it grows ever stronger, will it consume you or transform you into magic incarnate?

INVOKERS AND DEITIES
Choice of Deity: Like other divine characters, invokers are dedicated servants of one or more deities. Most invokers devote themselves to a single deity, but all invokers recognize the entire pantheon as worthy of respect (see "Deities," Player's Handbook, page 20). Whereas a cleric might revere Corellon and despise Lolth as a rival and enemy, an invoker dedicated to Corellon recognizes Lolth and her servants as comrades in arms against the forces that seek to destroy the world and the gods. That's not to say that you can't oppose the evil schemes of Lolth's followers if you're dedicated to Corellon, only that you shouldn't lose sight of the grander scheme of things.

Choice of Alignment: Invokers don't gain their power through rites of investiture or ordination, as avengers, clerics, and paladins do. You bear the touch of your god's own hand on your soul, a direct channel through which divine power can flow into the world, shaped by your will. Because you strive to bring your will into perfect accordance with your deity's, your alignment must match your deity's. For instance, an invoker of Moradin must be lawful good, an invoker of Pelor must be good, and an invoker of Ioun must be unaligned. </specific>
    <specific name="Implement"> Invokers do not make use of holy symbols, since they believe that their magic predates and transcends such representations of divine power. Instead, invokers make use of rods and staffs as representations of the gods' dominion over the world. When you wield a magic rod or a magic staff, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of invoker powers and invoker paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers. </specific>
    <specific name="Powers"> Your invoker powers are called prayers, but they are not as much supplications to the gods as direct manifestations of divine power. </specific>

At the dawn of time, the gods who inhabited the Astral Sea warred with the primordials of the Elemental Chaos, the mighty beings who shaped the world out of formless void. The greatest of the gods' mortal agents in that war were invokers, imbued with a fragment of the gods' own might to fight alongside them. No other mortal servant of the gods can claim the same kind of power. Through rites of investiture, avengers, clerics, and paladins gain the ability to manifest echoes of that power, uttering careful prayers and channeling divine energy through their holy symbols. You, however, channel your god's power directly. No mere symbol can contain it, for you speak the words of creation, shaping the universe to your and your god's will.

Perhaps you were trained in a secret monastery, or you studied in a library where the universe's oldest lore was preserved. Or perhaps you experienced the presence of your god firsthand and took a shard of divine power into yourself. You might even be an immortal born into flesh, slowly awakening to the awesome divine power that is your birthright. Whatever your past, you are among the gods' most trusted servants, bound to a covenant in which you swore to use divine power with great care. To what end will you wield that might?

Secretive and enigmatic, druids call the wilderness their home. They are capable of running with a wolf pack, speaking with the most ancient trees, and watching thunderstorms from atop the clouds themselves. They regard challenges as tests, both of their fitness and of their connection with the wild places of the world. And though many druids project an outward calm, they have the cunning of the beast and the fury of the storm.
Whether you were born to the wilds or retreated from civilization, whether you chose your path or answered a call that whispered in your heart, you share a bond with the primal spirits of nature. You are neither their servant nor their master, but winds, trees, and beasts heed your words, for they recognize you as kin.
Call to the spirits, and they will entangle your foes or smite your enemies with the storm. Unleash your own spirit, and you will become the Primal Beast, uncaged and untamed.

Some artificer powers have the weapon keyword and often require a  ranged weapon. If the ranged weapon fires ammunition, the ammunition carries the power's effect. Otherwise, the weapon carries the effect. When the attack is made, a mundane weapon returns to the artificer like a magic thrown weapon does. </specific>

	Artifice: An artifice is an object that consists of inanimate materials that are infused with and animated by magic. It does not occupy a square unless a power states otherwise. As a minor action, you can make your artifice move a number of squares equal to your Constitution modifier, or you can shift it 1 square. The artifice's defenses equal your level + 4,and it has hit points equal to your healing surge value. If an artifice drops to 0 hit points or is consumed, it is destroyed.

Artificers treat mastery of magic like a technical skill. They see patterns in energy and matter, and they understand how to manipulate the flow of magic in and around objects and creatures. Artificers channel energy into items using magical components, diagrams, and complex chains of sigils. Their skills let them assemble a magic device for any situation. 

As an artificer, you might be a formal student of magic who became interested in artifacts and arcane items. Alternatively, you could be a tinkerer who devised magic tools in a musty basement. Or perhaps you are an explorer who found your knowledge in the forgotten places of the world. Whatever the source of your talents, a passion for the technical components of magic drives you to perfect your art. 

With a bandolier slung across your chest, you carry an arsenal of alchemical compounds, magic implements, mundane materials, and tools. Your weapons, implements, and other gear are inscribed with runes and mystic patterns. You mix reagents, drink potions, and craft items. You use your knowledge to infuse yourself and your allies with arcane power. And one day, your magical skills will carry you into legend.

Characteristics: Your heavy armor allows you to take on your enemies' attacks without fear, and your melee attacks that are augmented by psionic magic let you control your enemies like puppets and set them up for defeat. You excel at controlling the battle line and forcing enemies to fight you while your allies wreak havoc.

Religion: Battleminds who live up to this class's renowned arrogance rarely pray to the gods, and stories abound of battleminds whose ill luck could be placed at the feet of their impiety. Those battleminds who do follow the gods typically revere Kord for his martial skill and strength, Bahamut for his practice of justice, or Ioun for being the originator of psionic magic.

Races: Half-elves are ideal quick battleminds, channeling their natural Charisma into psionic alacrity. Goliaths' sheer physical power makes them well suited for this class, and many gnome and tiefling warriors are drawn to the guile and trickery of some battlemind powers. </specific>

As wanderers, mercenaries, and adventurers, battleminds are carefree warriors who seek only to test their skill against the mightiest and most dangerous opponents. Battleminds possess a potent combination of psionic and physical skill, allowing them to use their magic to manipulate and deceive their foes even as their fighting skill lets them carve a swath through enemy ranks. Battleminds tend to be bold and sometimes arrogant, an attitude earned through bringing ruin to enemies over the course of many conflicts.

You might not share your fellow battleminds' arrogance, but you do have access to an array of combat abilities that let you manipulate, baffle, and defeat your enemies. Your mind is as deadly as your weapon, and with the aid of your psionic magic, your body can turn aside attacks as effectively as a suit of plate armor can.

Let those who would stand against your might quiver in terror when you approach, for you are a battlemind, and supremacy in combat is your birthright.

Bards are artists first and foremost, and they practice magic just as they practice song, drama, or poetry. They have a clear sense of how people perceive reality, so they master charm magic and some illusions. Sagas of great heroes are part of a bard's repertoire, and most bards follow the example of many fables and become skilled in a variety of fields. A bard's artistic ability, knowledge of lore, and arcane might are widely respected, particularly among the world's rulers.
Art and magic share a sublime beauty, and, as a bard, you seek the place where the two meet. You might be a naturally talented wanderer who casts impressive spells almost instinctively, a student of a bardic college who learned ordered systems of magic and epic poetry, a warrior skald who mixes skill at arms with thundering music, a dashing performer known for putting on a good show even for your enemies, or a perfectionist who seeks the consummate formula that blends art and magic into a higher force.
A steady rhythm beats in the back of your mind as you brandish your sword. Your eyes and ears pick up the motion of the villains that surround you, and one glance tells you everything you need to know to defeat them.

Religion
Swordmages favor deities of magic or skill. Corellon, Selûne, Torm, and Tymora are common among swordmages of good heart. Swordmages of a darker bent often revere Shar, regarding their unusual skills as a secret art to be kept hidden from the uninitiated. </specific>

Swordmages apply the arcane arts to melee combat. The combat skills they possess are enhanced by the magic they wield. The flourish of a swordmage's blade not only bites with steel, but also with fire, lightning, or other powerful forces.
	You studied and practiced for years to master your skills. You mastered the fundamentals of arcane magic and combined this academic study with endless hours of physical training. You might be a young eladrin in search of your fortune, a stranger to the wider world outside the seclusion of your homeland; a self-trained genasi sellsword, gifted with an affinity for elemental magic; the scion of a disgraced noble human family, taught by the finest tutors in your youth but now a footloose expatriate; or a half-elf arcane champion, rigorously trained in a war magic academy to serve in the armies of your homeland.
	Magical barriers of force swirl around you, protecting you from harm. The blade you carry is an extension of your being, both body and mind. It pulses with eldritch energy as you prepare to defend your allies and unleash magical fury against your foes.

	A cloak of spells enfolds you, ancient rituals bolster your senses, and runed implements of your craft hang from your belt. Effervescing arcane lore pulses through your consciousness, a constant pressure craving release. When will you know enough magic to storm the ramparts of reality itself?

Warlords are accomplished and competent battle leaders. Warlords stand on the front line issuing commands and bolstering their allies while leading the battle with weapon in hand. Warlords know how to rally a team to win a fight.
	Your ability to lead others to victory is a direct result of your history. You could be a minor warchief looking to make a name for yourself, a pious knight-commander on leave from your militant order, a youthful noble eager to apply years of training to life outside the castle walls, a calculating mercenary captain, or a courageous marshal of the borderlands who fights to protect the frontier. Regardless of your background, you are a skillful warrior with an uncanny gift for leadership.
	The weight of your armor is not a hindrance; it is a familiar comfort. The worn weapon grip molds to your hand as if it were a natural extension of your arm. It's time to fight and to lead.

Warlocks channel arcane might wrested from primeval entities. They commune with infernal intelligences and fey spirits, scour enemies with potent blasts of eldritch power, and bedevil foes with hexing curses. Armed with esoteric secrets and dangerous lore, warlocks are clever and resourceful foes.
	However you came to your arcane knowledge, you need not accept the poor reputation warlocks sometimes endure. You could be a libram-toting scholar captivated by ominous lore, a foot-loose wanderer searching for elusive ultimate truths, a devil-touched hunter using infernal spells to eliminate evil, or even a black-clad mercenary who uses sinister trappings to discourage prying strangers and unwanted attention. On the other hand, you could be a true diabolist using your gifts to tyrannize the weak—some warlocks unfortunately are exactly that.
	The pacts are complete. The rites have concluded. The signs are drawn in blood, and the seals are broken. Your destiny beckons.

Rangers are watchful warriors who roam past the horizon to safeguard a region, a principle, or a way of life. Masters of bow and blade, rangers excel at hit-and-run assaults and can quickly and silently eliminate foes. Rangers lay superb ambushes and excel at avoiding danger.
	As a ranger, you possess almost supernaturally keen senses and a deep appreciation for untamed wilderness. With your knowledge of the natural world, you are able to track enemies through nearly any landscape, using the smallest clue to set your course, even sometimes the calls and songs of beasts and birds. Your severe demeanor promises a deadly conclusion to any enemy you hunt.
	When you catch sight of your quarry, will the transgressor perish by swift bow shots from a distance, or by the twofold blades that glint and glitter in each of your battle-scarred hands?

    <specific name="Supplemental"> DIVINE SANCTION
Many new paladin powers and some of the new feats in this book subject a target to your divine sanction. Being subject to it means the target is marked by you for a duration specified in the description of the power or feat. Unless otherwise noted, the mark ends before the specified duration if someone else marks the target.
Until the mark ends, the target takes radiant damage equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier the first time each round it makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target. The damage increases to 6 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 9 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level.
Divine sanction is meant to complement divine challenge. You can use divine challenge to mark one creature and use divine sanction to mark others. Divine sanction has fewer restrictions than divine challenge so that you can easily use the two in concert.


PALADINS AND DEITIES
As fervent crusaders in their chosen cause, paladins must choose a deity. Paladins choose a specific faith to serve, as well as an alignment. You must choose an alignment identical to the alignment of your patron deity; a paladin of a good deity must be good, a paladin of a lawful good deity must be lawful good, and a paladin of an unaligned deity must be unaligned. Evil and chaotic evil paladins do exist in the world, but they are almost always villains, not player characters.
	Paladins are not granted their powers directly by their deity, but instead through various rites performed when they first become paladins. Most of these rites involve days of prayer, vigils, tests and trials, and ritual purification followed by a knighting ceremony, but each faith has its own methods. This ceremony of investiture gives a paladin the ability to wield divine powers. Once initiated, the paladin is a paladin forevermore. How justly, honorably, or compassionately the paladin wields those powers from that day forward is up to him, and paladins who stray too far from the tenets of their faith are punished by other members of the faithful.

Paladins are indomitable warriors who've pledged their prowess to something greater than themselves. Paladins smite enemies with divine authority, bolster the courage of nearby companions, and radiate as if a beacon of inextinguishable hope. Paladins are transfigured on the field of battle, exemplars of divine ethos in action.
	To you is given the responsibility to unflinchingly stand before an enemy's charge, smiting them with your sword while protecting your allies with your sacrifice. Where others waver and wonder, your motivation is pure and simple, and your devotion is your strength. Where others scheme and steal, you take the high road, refusing to allow the illusions of temptation to dissuade you from your obligations.
	Take up your blessed sword and sanctified shield brave warrior, and charge forward to hallowed glory!

    <specific name="Supplemental"> FIGHTERS AND MELEE WEAPONS
Fighters master intricacies of melee weapon skill that other characters can't match. Unlike other classes, fighters have many encounter powers that work better when used with specific groups of melee weapons. Powers associated with a weapon group favor a particular ability score mix, so that fighters with high Constitution are likely to want to use axes, hammers, or picks, while fighters with high Dexterity are more likely to favor heavy blades, light blades, flails, or spears. The weapon feats described in Chapter 6 that provide optimized abilities for specific groups of weapons favor the same ability score mixes, so the list below notes the melee weapon groups and the ability score that is most likely to help you optimize your fighter abilities with that weapon group.
	Most melee weapon groups, with the exception of light blades, require some element of Strength to access the weapon feats that improve their importance. (Light blades have some feats that require only Dexterity, though other light blade feats also require a modicum of Strength.) The list of weapon groups below mentions the ability score other than Strength that helps access the feats that improve a specific group of weapons, as well as fighter powers that are tied to specific groups of weapons.
	Strength is mentioned in the list only if a weapon group has unusually high requirements for Strength.
	A few weapons, including most polearms, are part of multiple groups and can therefore be approached from different optimal ability score builds.
&lt;table&gt;Melee Weapon	Groups and Associated Statistics
Axe	Constitution and higher than normal Strength (battleaxe, handaxe, greataxe, halberd)
Flail	Dexterity (flail, heavy flail, spiked chain)
Hammer	Constitution (maul, throwing hammer, warhammer)
Heavy Blade	Dexterity (bastard sword, falchion, glaive, greatsword, longsword, scimitar, scythe)
Light Blade	Dexterity alone is sometimes enough (dagger, katar, rapier, short sword, shuriken, sickle)
Mace	Constitution (club, great club, mace, morningstar)
Pick	Constitution [and rarely Dexterity] (war pick)
Polearm	Wisdom [and rarely Dexterity] (glaive, halberd, longspear)
Spear	Dexterity (javelin, longspear, spear)
Staff	Constitution (quarterstaff)&lt;/table&gt; </specific>
    <specific name="Powers"> Your powers are called exploits. Some work better for great weapon fighters and some work better for guardian fighters, but you can choose any power you like when you reach a level that allows you to choose a new power. The choice of weapon you make also provides benefits to certain fighter powers. </specific>

Fighters are determined combat adepts trained to protect the other members of their adventuring groups. Fighters define the front line by bashing and slicing foes into submission while reflecting enemy attacks through the use of heavy armor. Fighters draw weapons for gold, for glory, for duty, and for the mere joy of unrestrained martial exercise.
	Regardless of your level of skill and the specific weapons you eventually master, your motivations determine who you defend and who you slay. You could be a noble champion who pledges your blade to gallant causes, a calculating mercenary who cares more for the clink of gold than praise, a homeless prince on the run from assassins, or a blood-loving thug looking for the next good fight.
	Your future is yours. When you unsheathe your weapon, what battle cry flies from your lips?

CLERICS AND DEITIES
All clerics choose a specific faith to which they devote themselves. Usually this faith is the worship of a specific patron deity–for example, Moradin, Pelor, or Erathis. Sometimes clerics are devoted to churches that venerate groups of deities or even philosophies.
	As a cleric, your deity does not directly grant you powers. Instead, your ordination or investiture as a cleric grants you the ability to wield divine powers. Clerics are usually formally ordained by existing clerics who perform a special ritual to do so, but on rare occasions a deity moves to directly ordain a worthy worshiper without any sort of priestly hierarchy involved. What you do with your powers once you are ordained is up to you, although if you flagrantly and openly defy your deity's tenets, you quickly earn the enmity of the faithful.
Good, Lawful Good, and Unaligned Deities
&lt;table&gt;Deity	Alignment	Areas of Influence
Avandra	Good	Change, luck, trade, travel
Bahamut	Lawful good	Justice, honor, nobility,
		protection
Corellon	Unaligned	Arcane magic, spring,

Raven Queen	Unaligned	Death, fate, winter
Sehanine	Unaligned	Trickery, moon, love, autumn&lt;/table&gt;
Evil and Chaotic Evil Deities
&lt;table&gt;Deity	Alignment	Areas of Influence
Asmodeus	Evil	Power, domination, tyranny
Bane	Evil	War, conquest
Gruumsh	Chaotic evil	Turmoil, destruction
Lolth	Chaotic evil	Spiders, shadows, lies
Tiamat	Evil	Wealth, greed, vengeance
Torog	Evil	Underdark, imprisonment
Vecna	Evil	Undeath, secrets
Zehir	Evil	Darkness, poison, serpents&lt;/table&gt;
You must choose a deity compatible with your alignment: Good clerics serve good deities, lawful good clerics serve lawful good deities, and so on. If a deity is unaligned, your alignment doesn't matter–so a deity such as Melora has good, lawful good, evil, chaotic evil, and unaligned clerics in her service. Similarly, if you're unaligned, you can serve any god. For example, Pelor is served by both good clerics and unaligned clerics, but never by evil, chaotic evil, or lawful good clerics.
	For most games, you should choose a good, lawful good, or unaligned deity for your cleric. Ask your Dungeon Master before you select an evil or chaotic evil deity. </specific>

Clerics are battle leaders who are invested with divine power. They blast foes with magical prayers, bolster and heal companions, and lead the way to victory with a mace in one hand and a holy symbol in the other. Clerics run the gamut from humble servants of the common folk to ruthless enforcers of evil gods.
	As a cleric, the deity (or deities) you choose to revere goes a long way toward defining you, or at least how other people in the world see you. You could be a platinum-garbed envoy of Bahamut seeking justice throughout the land, a shadowy follower of Sehanine with a roguish streak, a burly disciple of Kord who believes the virtue of strength is sufficient for all challenges, or a dwarf cleric of Moradin bringing honor to the denizens of your mountain home.
	Will you protect what is sacred to your god, quest for legendary holy artifacts, pursue a life of evangelical adventuring, or attempt all these deeds and more?
