Pistols are simple one-handed firearms.

Properties:
Load Standard (Ranged weapons fire metal ammunition by using explosive alchemicals and take some time to load. When a weapon shows "load free" on the weapon table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The firearm is "load standard," which means it requires a standard action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.).
Brutal 2 (A brutal weapon's minimum damage is higher than that of a normal weapon. When rolling the weapon's damage, reroll any die that displays a value equal to or lower than the brutal value given for the weapon. Reroll the die until the value shown exceeds the weapon's brutal value, and then use the new value.).
High Crit (A high crit weapon deals more damage when you score a critical hit with it. A critical hit deals maximum weapon damage and an extra 1[W] at 1st thru 10th levels, an extra 2[W] at 11th thru 20th levels, and an extra 3[W] at 21st thru 30th levels. This extra damage is in addition to any critical damage the weapon supplies if it is a magic weapon.)

A long, scooped basket fitted to a glovelike bracer, the dejada is used to hurl projectiles. Ammunition can be a fist-sized stone, but the weapon is also used to extend the range of explosive alchemical mixtures.

Properties: 
Load Free (Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load. When a weapon shows “load free” on the ranged weapons table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.).

Short blades attach to either end of this staff. In the center of this double weapon is a guard with a protruding blade perpendicular to the staff. The light, middle blade (which serves as the off-hand end) can be used for quick jabs, ideal for a warrior with a roguish bent.

Also known as the pincer staff, this Draji polearm was developed to grab and control targets that might be captured for later sacrifice. It consists of a long haft with a crossbar at the end with two pincerlike tines attached. The pincers are often actual mandible pieces from giant insects.

Properties: 
High Crit (A high crit weapon deals more damage when you score a critical hit with it. A critical hit deals maximum weapon damage and an extra 1[W] at 1st–10th levels, an extra 2[W] at 11th–20th levels, and an extra 3[W] at 21st–30th levels. This extra damage is in addition to any critical damage the weapon supplies if it is a magic weapon.).

Simple one-handed ranged weapon
Cost: 10 gp

Proficient: +2
Range: 10/20
Weight: 4 lb.

A long, scooped basket fitted to a glovelike bracer, the dejada is used to hurl projectiles. Ammunition can be a fist-sized stone, but the weapon is also used to extend the range of explosive alchemical mixtures.

Properties: 
Load Free (Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load. When a weapon shows “load free” on the ranged weapons table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.).

Superior double melee weapon
Cost: 10 gp
Damage: 1d10
Proficient: +2
Range: -
Weight: 3 lb.
Originally a tool used by farmers and peasants to tend crops and for a variety of other mundane uses, the kusari-gama was adopted as a weapon by the ninja because of both its flexibility and its ability to pass unnoticed as a common item.
This weapon features a sickle (or kama) on one end of a chain and a heavy weight on the other, with the weight swung with great force and used to either entangle or trip a foe, and the kama used to slice at a vital part of the body.
Properties:
Defensive (A defensive weapon grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you wield the defensive weapon in one hand and wield another melee weapon in your other hand. Wielding more than one defensive weapon does not increase this bonus. To gain this benefit, you need not attack with the defensive weapon, but you must be proficient with it.).
Reach (With a reach weapon, you can attack enemies that are 2 squares away from you as well as adjacent enemies, with no attack penalty. You can still make opportunity attacks only against adjacent enemies. Likewise, you can flank only an adjacent enemy.).
Group:
Flail (Weapons in the flail group have a flexible material, usually a length of chain, between a solid handle and the damage-dealing end of the weapon.). </specific>

Properties: 
Load Minor (Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load. When a weapon shows "load free" on the weapon table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is "load minor," which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.).

Properties: 
Load Free (Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load. When a weapon shows “load free” on the ranged weapons table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.).

You have a battlefist, which replaces your hand. The battlefist is a melee weapon with which you are proficient. It is a part of the mace weapon group, deals 1d8 damage, and has a +3 proficiency bonus. You can hold items in your battlefist as though it were your hand, but you must not be holding anything when you use your battlefist as a weapon. You can use the Enchant Magic Item, Disenchant Magic Item, and Transfer Enchantment rituals on the battlefist. Using Disenchant Magic Item on the battlefist does not destroy it.

You can make unarmed attacks with much greater effectiveness than most combatants. When you make a weapon attack such as a melee basic attack, you can use the monk unarmed strike, which is a weapon in the unarmed weapon group. This weapon has the off-hand weapon property and a +3 proficiency bonus, and it deals 1d8 damage. You must have a hand free to use your monk unarmed strike, even if you're kicking, kneeing, elbowing, or head-butting a target. Also, your monk unarmed strike can benefit from a magic ki focus if you have one.

    *UPDATE* The rules for monk unarmed strikes has changed since the playtest. Your unarmed strike no longer can be enchanted, nor does it function as an implement. Talk with your DM about updating your character. A suggested resolution is to sell your enchanted unarmed strike and then purchase a Ki Focus in its place.

Load Minor (Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load.

Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is "load minor," which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.).

Superior two-handed ranged weapon
Cost: 30 gp
Damage: 1d10
Proficient: +3
Range: 20/40
Weight: 6 lb.

This crossbow appears similar to a traditional crossbow, but it has knobs and dials that allow the weapon to be fine-tuned for greater accuracy.

Properties: 
Load Minor (Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load. When a weapon shows “load free” on the weapon table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.).

Group: 
Crossbow (Essentially a small metal bow mounted on a stock and equipped with a mechanical trigger, a crossbow is a point-and-shoot projectile weapon. Crossbows are popular because they require little training to master, yet the heavy pull of the metal bow gives them substantial power.). </specific>

Properties: 
Off-Hand (An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can't attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.).
