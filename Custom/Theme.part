Flint's industrial docks with their unusual conflux of peasant workers, educated engineers, and constantly arriving refugees from the wars in the border states between Danor and Drakr have in the past decade given birth to an unorthodox social movement. Graffiti artists brighten soot cloaked warehouses with colorful murals and boastful self-portraits. Dancers and musicians bolster moods in breezy bars, while amateur philosophers giddy on fey pepper entertain drunken teamsters withhumorous moral puzzles that often mock public figures.
Occasionally these popular artists, called dockers, get it in their heads to start a riot or get a tad too precise with their criticism. The dockers and the city police have each taken their hits in these confrontations, and tensions grow higher with every accidental death, but for now Roland Stanfield, the city governor of Flint, seems to have a soft spot for these tepid anarchists. 
Role: Leader

Playing a Docker.
The docker spirit is not limited just to those who perform in public, but extends to anyone who suffers through hard work and low wages, yet can still appreciate intelligent art for its sublime beauty. The worse conditions get for the workers in Flint, though, the more they turn to dockers for relief from their fatigue. When things get heated, every good docker needs to be able to handle himself in a scrap.
Sometimes a docker gets in over his head, and with a little help from sympathetic bar owners or police officers he'll drop out of the scene and find a new, safer career. In this way, the docker movement has spread to pockets of the city slums and even out to the surrounding farmlands. One popular song on the docks even tells of a graffiti artist who fled to Crisillyir and is now painting cathedrals with subversive interpretations of the Clergy's doctrines

Benefit: If you choose Docker as your character's theme, the party's Prestige with Flint starts at 2 instead of 1. See "Prestige," page 15. Additionally, you gain the following power at 1st level.

The Heid Eschatol movement began among the dwarves of Drakr, after the scholar Vlendam Heid published a treatise on the myths of his nation and how they continued to influence modern perceptions. The book captured the culture's consciousness, particularly a section that used the legend of the Lost Riders to explain the Drakran tradition of defining civilizations and eras by how they end. In the three decades since its publication, Heid's "On the Proper Endings of Things" has given birth to a whole field of academic study devoted to finding the perfect way to end friendships and romances, business relationships, wars, serialized literature, and even one's own life.
Heid's disciples refer to themselves as eschatologists, from the term for the study of the end of the world. Their popularity has only strengthened Drakr's existing obsession with apocalyptic prophecies and doomsaying, and has raised awareness of their beliefs in other nations. The Clergy, however, denies that the dwarven endtimes are near, and its agents take a dim view of Heid's followers.
Role: Controller.

Playing an Eschatologist.
Dwarves from any nation likely feel some sympathy toward Heid Eschatol, and soldiers who fought in the wars in the border kingdoms between Drakr and Danor often saw enough horrors that when they came home they were comforted by the thought of an orderly judgment day. A handful of apocalyptic cults have sprung up, and increasingly their members are seen less as fringe nuts and more as just another religious sect. Only a few outside of Drakr actually believe in a literal imminent end of the world, with most adherents simply appreciating the comfort they can find by confronting death with reason instead of fear.
Regardless of how a character was drawn to Heid's movement, he is likely to give regular thought to the future, especially to life's thresholds and endings. Every eschatologist regularly updates his will, and pays heed to his companions' desires in the event of their untimely yet unavoidable deaths. A few race toward death, but most are pragmatic and take exceptional precautions to forestall any accidental demise that might ruin their plans.

Benefit: If you choose Eschatologist as your character's theme, the first time each encounter that you or one of your allies would die from a failed death saving throw, that character may choose to stabilize instead. Additionally, you gain the following power at 1st level.

Knowledge of fusils, the cylindrical weapons that use explosive alchemical reactions to propel bullets at deadly speeds has existed for centuries, but these weapons were considered inferior to existing magical attacks, which were more accurate and had less risk of accidental death. Only after the Great Malice did the Danoran military begin to refine and improve fusils. The latest innovations in these weapons, now commonly called "guns," have led to their spread into Risur and Drakr, where industrial production helps equip armies with firepower on par with a well-trained sorcerer.
Firearms fascinate gunsmiths, who are not content simply to purchase and practice with guns. They tweak and tinker with their own refinements, and whenever two such craftsmen cross paths they bargain and deal for each other's secrets. Especially now that firearms have moved beyond the null magic lands of Danor, seemingly limitless possibilities have opened up for the development of weapons that mix spellcraft and chemistry. Flint's city governor Roland Stanfield is already planning a technological exposition where gunsmiths and other inventors can showcase their creations.
Role: Striker.

Playing a Gunsmith.
Not all gunsmiths devote their combat training to wielding firearms; some just like to have the weapons for their aesthetic appeal, or to take advantage of the common man's fear of their power. More often, though, gunsmiths practice endlessly to improve their aim, and try to learn as many trick shots as possible to prove the superiority of their chosen killing device. Those with magical training often master rituals to enchant their pistols. One gunsmith, Lerema Kurtz, is said to be able to conjure a cannon from her petticoat pocket. 
Many romanticize the deadly purity of guns, or decorate their weapons with baroque inlays and carvings. A few gunsmiths, however, take a bleaker view, rejecting any form of poetry. They just know guns are damned good at killing people, and that life's as good as worthless when a bullet costs less than a mug of beer.

Benefit: If you choose Gunsmith as your character's theme, you can perform the ritual enchant magic item in order to create firearms and firearm ammunition. Additionally, you gain the following power at 1st level.  Additionally pistols gain the off-hand quality.

In the war academies of Danor, students speak of combat like a science. Their curriculum involves not merely practicing forms and maneuvers, but writing theses about renowned warriors, or crafting and defending theorems regarding the mechanics of swordplay. The normally reserved Danorans honor the graduates of these battle colleges like other nations honor great poets and sculptors. As those warriors have proven the efficacy of their innovative techniques, the sentiment has spread throughout Lanjyr, and other nations have founded similar schools. 
Any brute can hurl a spear or hack through a ribcage, but students of the war academies bring reason to the savagery of war. Often rising to high military ranks, these scholars of battle study anatomy and perform autopsies to learn vulnerabilities of the body, learn physical theorems that underlie the most effective angles of attack and defense, and take time to ponder the psychological and sociological considerations of mortal conflict from the vast scope and human cost of an invasion, down to the emotional resonance and cultural significance of specific sword techniques through history.
Role: Striker.

Playing a Martial Scientist
Danor has the greatest concentration of war colleges, but the Banhaman Academy in Risur's capital Slate has a reputation for elite siege engineers and artillerists, and the Battalion outside of Flint has a reputation for training the best wilderness forces in Lanjyr. Smaller local schools mostly serve to provide pensions for retired soldiers turned tutors, but even they have led to noteworthy theses, such as The Wounding Effectiveness of Stealthy Singular Rapier contrasted with a Twin Strike of Dual Long Swords, which provoked a very spirited debate and even a few expulsions when things got heated.
In Drakr, emphasis is given to testing the physiological limits of endurance and surviving in battle with limited resources, as would be likely in a world-ending conflict. The Clergy in Crisillyir add a strong theological and monstrous anatomy component to the students in their military academies. The lone war college in Ber has a vast library of battle songs, which according to a disputed theory will inspire the courage and attack accuracy of soldiers, though most likely it is just meant to keep in check the often wild emotions of its bestial students.
You should work with your DM to determine what your graduate thesis was, unless you left before finishing your education.

Benefit: If you choose Martial Scientist as your character's theme, you gain training in History. If you already are trained in History, you may gain training in another skill. You are proficient in all military weapons. Additionally, you gain the following power at 1st level.

Truly ancient lore suggests that once the mortal races were able to ravel to the stars with the aid of lost magic, much like demons and angels can be briefly summoned into this world. But for the full length of remembered history, the heavens have been nearly inscrutable. The druids, used to thinking in long terms of seasons, years, and the lifespan of trees, were the first to notice subtle connections between the movements of stars and the affairs of this world. They too were first to learn how to step through the veils that lead to the Dreaming or the Bleak Gate, and without their aid King Kelland could never have defeated the fey titans.
For over a thousand years, the druids would gaze into the sky night after night, awaiting dreams that would grant revelations of the future. These seers, by guiding journeyers and heroes with their visions, averted many catastrophes. When the Second Victory led to Srasama's fall, the skyseers read the signs and helped hundreds of eladrin women flee their homeland so they could avoid genocide.
In the past few centuries, however, the many orders and factions of skyseers in Risur have struggled to divine much of import from the stars. Their visions, never precise or clear to begin with, failed to foresee the rise of Danor's industry, failed to avert scores of natural disasters and man-made tragedies. The people of Risur still go through the motions of skyseer rituals, but the old druids' influence has faded. Few young people today aspire to join their once-prestigious ranks.
Role: Leader.

Playing a Skyseer.
Those few who study to be skyseers today usually have a close mentor among the druids. Some may have spent countless nights as children staring up at the stars, before one night waking from a vivid, prophetic dream. Apprenticed to an elder skyseer, they learned the names of the stars and planets, their patterns and influence. Though precise visions are rare, it is still indisputable that magic of travel works better under the full moon, and that any ship that sets sail the night when Jiese enters retrograde within the constellation of the Mad Pirate will face great misfortune before it reaches its destination.
Skyseers favor the night, and with a glance at the starry sky can tell time as precisely as any clock. Even in this new age of technology, most Risuri ship's captains won't sail beyond sight of shore without a skyseer aboard. Though their influence has faded somewhat, they still have strong connections with many families, villages, and organizations, and they can easily find a welcome home as long as they do not begin speaking of prophecies.

Benefit: If you choose Skyseer as your character's theme, you gain the following powers at 1st level.

The Danoran industrial revolution has changed the ways of war, giving even the poorest man weapons that can kill the wealthy and well equipped. Why then should not matters of the soul also move from the purview of the enlightened into the grasp of the common people? So ask spirit mediums, who wish to explain the mysteries of spirits and the afterlife so that men no longer need priests to tell them what awaits beyond death.
Certainly, many mediums are charlatans who prey on the weakness of bereaved aristocrats. But a few have discovered how to contact the dead through a form of psionic meditation called a seance. Some will only use their talents to help those who have a sincere need to know the secrets of the dead, and will only train students who share the same worldview, but most mediums reject such insularity as smacking of organized religion, and will gladly wake the dead for a quick chat at the drop of a few coins.
Role: Controller.

Playing a Spirit Medium.
The ability to speak with the recently departed is of great value to the Royal Homeland Constabulary, which recruits enthusiastically people with useful talents. Compared with the normal life of a medium, criminal investigators seldom have to convey messages between the dead and their living friends and relatives, though such conversations can help elicit otherwise unyielding secrets.

Some people cannot get enough of new technology. Those with talent tinker or create. Those without collect, study, or simply nag every engineer and inventor they meet. Whether dabblers or professionals, often these technology enthusiasts come up with ideas for devices that straddle the line between clever and impractical.
In Danor, academies train technologists in specialized fields, while in Drakr master dwarven craftsmen guide huge stables of apprentices in the massive engineering projects. Crisillyir punishes such tinkering with holy flagellation, as do colonists in Elfaivar, whereas the native eladrin are as unsettled by technology as are the denizens of the Dreaming. A few enterprising technologists in Ber curry favor of the royal court, which responds eagerly to such intellectual pursuits.
Role: Controller.

Playing a Technologist.
After centuries of reliance upon swords, bows, plate armor, and the occasional arcane evocation, keeping up with the modern pace of developing technology is daunting to many power groups, especially law enforcement and the military. Such groups might enlist technologists as specialists to explain unfamiliar devices, or to craft specialty weapons or tools. While the Danoran industrial revolution has mass-produced many common tools and weapons, only a few have the knowledge and talent to create custom items.
Technologists tend to gather lots of disposable tools and weapons, so that they always have something handy in an unusual situation. Many make a point to learn a bit of magic or alchemy as well, though every technologist is inspired by a different vision of what technology can provide.

Benefit: If you choose Technologist as your character's theme, you will have access to certain technological information and resources not readily available to other characters. Additionally, you gain the following power at 1st level.

If fatalism defines the traditional dwarven philosophy, then the cornerstone of eladrin ideology is that living well is the best revenge. After the goddess Srasama died and nearly all eladrin women perished with her, there was a great drive in Elfaivar to fight until the last man in a short-sighted bid for vengeance. As the rest of the nation whipped itself into a frenzy, however, a composer named Vekesh wrote a song of mourning that contained a simple sentiment: defeat is only tragedy if we choose to let the story end.
While many eladrin could not be stopped from their self-destruction, Vekesh convinced some of his people that a tale that goes from defeat to revenge to death is a shameful tragedy. Revenge serves only to distract from one's grief, but is ultimately valueless. Instead, he said, a tale of defeat, resilience, and renewal is the best way to thwart their enemies' goals. The proper form of retribution, then, is to endure, rebuild from weakness, and prosper into strength.
His guidance ensured that in at least a few isolated enclaves, the eladrin race pulled back from the brink of annihilation. In the following decades a loosely codified collection of vekeshi teachings spread throughout Lanjyr. The mantras of Vekesh have helped many cope with loss and find a new path for themselves.
To the general public, though, "Vekeshi" is synonymous with murderer and terrorist. While the majority of Vekeshi avoid violence when possible, Vekesh believed that taking up arms is sometimes necessary to protect those at their most vulnerable. The deepest secrets of vekeshi mysticism are taught only to a rare few adherents who demonstrate a skill for battle, and the wisdom to know when to use their power.
Role: Defender.

Playing a Vekeshi Mystic.
Anyone might casually study Vekesh's teachings for a bit of personal guidance, but to be initiated into the mystical side of the philosophy requires painful rituals. Aspirants are taken in the night across the threshold of the Dreaming, where they experience the fall of Srasama through psychic illusions, making them keepers of the shared memory of the Great Malice. Thereafter they are held in a cage for days, along with poisoned food that they must resist, so that the starvation teaches them the importance of patience. Finally, they are burnt until their skin blackens, and then are magically healed to seal in the power of the flames.
If a vekeshi passes these trials, he rests and recovers in luxury as his teachers instruct him in the secrets of the philosophy, and drill into him the necessity of discretion. Upon leaving the Dreaming, vekeshi mystics return to their normal lives, but seek positions of power in military, law enforcement, or the underworld, where they use their authority to punish those who continually threaten people who are simply trying to make a better life for themselves.
Vekeshi mystics seldom gather in large groups, but on certain irregular lunar holidays they slip into the Dreaming for secretive festivals. Only on the rarest occasions will a mystic be called to act openly. Donning an iconic mantle of eladrin armor and a mask that conceals his face, the mystic acts as the surrogate hand of the fallen goddess Srasama, with the sole purpose of meting out punishment against one directly responsible for large-scale suffering.

The islands of the Yerasol Archipelago were perhaps the most verdant, beautiful battleground in history. During two centuries of intermittent warfare, untold thousands of soldiers from Risur and Danor died among the windblown rainforests and flowered beaches of those isles, trying to protect their homelands' exceedingly prosperous plantations. Those who survived the ones who didn't succumb to aberrant infections, crippling physical injuries, or unyielding mental trauma often turned their war time glory into profit or political clout.
Poets of the two nations memorialized the greatest acts of heroism from the Four Yerasol Wars, the last of which ended seven years past. It's an open secret that history is written by the survivors, and many socalled war heroes were merely lucky enough to witness something brave and amazing, and not die in the process so they could take the credit for themselves. A rare few, however, demonstrated genuine heroism and lived to have their tales told by others.
Role: Defender.

Playing a Yerasol Veteran.
Everyone knows the names of a few veterans who distinguished themselves in battle not quite famous, but certainly memorable. Every veteran of the isles has a story that made him a celebrity, though many do not enjoy recounting their tales. The fact that everyone likes a war hero doesn't lessen the trauma of having seen friends die.
After two centuries of trial and error, though, Risur and Danor have learned to exploit these heroes of the moment, giving them cushy jobs and helping them reacclimate to civilian life. It doesn't do to have a "hero" become a drunkard and embarrass his nation, after all. The aid and adulation from their nation helps a great many Yerasol veterans become pillars of their communities. Such aid quickly dries up, though,
should a hero ever decide to publicly criticize his homeland.

The minstrels of Athas are entertainers to the wealthy and powerful elite of the city-states. Singers, acrobats, poets, dancers, and storytellers, minstrels tour the cities of Athas in troupes or individually, making a living with their wits and talents. The civilized peoples of Athas have long celebrated minstrels, and by tradition all but the poorest or most suspicious of hosts are proud to open their doors to traveling performers. Hosting a minstrel or sponsoring a troupe's performance reflects well on the host, and most Athasians are eager to forget their troubles with a few hours of song and dance. Nobles often send troupes of minstrels to one another as gifts; it is seen as a great insult to refuse such a gift, even when all involved know that minstrels are often spies or assassins.
	The most skilled (or fortunate) minstrels are highly paid companions to nobility, trusted advisors or agents who enjoy the most intimate confidences of their patrons. Minstrels are often retained by noble houses to tutor young nobles or teach them about the world. They might serve as bodyguards and fighting instructors at the same time. Minstrels who belong to a troupe lack the comfort and trust bestowed on a kept minstrel, but they enjoy the freedom to travel and the aid of a network of informants and allies throughout the Tyr Region. The poorest and most humble minstrels are simple wandering storytellers or jugglers who perform for their supper from night to night.
	Many minstrels have a dark side they conceal beneath their charm and talent. Those with ambition and ruthlessness find opportunities in the employ of the elite classes. Minstrels often lead double lives as blackmailers, thieves, spies, or assassins; a minstrel's visit or a troupe's performance might conceal a mission of espionage or murder. They are renowned as masters of poison, concealed weapons, and subtle trickery. Even the humblest wandering minstrel with threadbare cloak and battered lyre might be more than he or she seems-there's no better spy than someone who seems harmless and is welcome wherever he or she goes.
Creating: All minstrels are skilled performers or artists. Naturally, many are bards. However, you might be an assassin or a rogue who conceals your true talents with dancing or juggling, a battlemind specializing in tricks of the mind, or even a fighter or a warlord whose musical ability is secondary to your talent for teaching young nobles how to look after themselves.

Dune traders roam every civilized corner of the known world. From crowded marketplaces crawling with thieves, to caravans wending across difficult wastes, to the isolated settlements and trading posts found in the places between the great city-states, dune traders are everywhere, pushing their wares on anyone they encounter. Dune traders bring needed goods to remote areas, offering water, food, arms, and more, but their work is not charity. Such offerings come at the highest prices a merchant can ask and still be able to move the merchandise. It's all about making a profit, and no one does a better job at looking out for themselves and their wealth than the dune traders of Athas.
	Many small traders and merchant cabals exist, but they pale next to the dynastic houses that dominate trade across the Tyr Region. These houses are nations unto themselves, sworn to no sorcerer-king but allied with all. They field their own armies, hold their own lands, and take an active part in political and social developments affecting the region. A merchant house's leadership might rest in one family's hands, but these houses readily accept new members, always looking for new talent to bolster their presence and influence in the Tyr Region. Regardless of the position sought, candidates must swear several oaths to the house leaders. In exchange, a candidate receives protection, status, and regular pay. The particular oaths vary from house to house, but the following are common to them all.
• Forsake any citizenship or membership in a city-state or tribe.
• Swear allegiance to the merchant house.
• Always act in the merchant house's best interest.
• Deal honestly with stranger, friend, and foe.
• Flaunt no wealth gained through employment by the house.
• Uphold the local laws and always act in accordance with them.
• Protect your own, lending help to merchants in need and refusing to deal with those who unjustly imprison or harass any merchant.
	In contrast to the great dynastic houses of the city-states, elven merchant tribes are small and mobile. They do not enjoy the peaceful relations enjoyed by the dynastic houses and, for this reason, they are not beholden to any oaths or promises. They foist off junk, deal in contraband, and sometimes resort to base robbery if given sufficient cause. Elven houses tend to be tribal in structure, but they are as widespread and as dangerous as any human organization.
Creating: The merchant houses populating the Tyr Region welcome anyone with talent into their fold. Rogues and bards have the most to offer merchant houses, since they have the abilities most useful for negotiating and bargaining in the marketplaces. Warlords are excellent caravan leaders, and psionically gifted characters use their subtle arts to ferret out secrets and gain the upper hand over rival houses. Finally, merchant houses frequently recruit muscle such as fighters, wardens, and barbarians to ensure that caravans arrive at their destinations.

The gods of Athas are little more than half-remembered myths in the current age, but many of those who live beneath the crimson sun give their devotion and worship to other powers. Some worship sorcererkings who claim to be divine, or the false deities other sorcerer-kings purport to serve. Some worship demons or primordials-grim, malevolent patrons that frequently demand terrible rites or horrendous acts of sacrifice. But most Athasians instead venerate the living elements as they manifest in the world.
	Elemental priests are those who serve these sullen and fierce spirits. They have a special kinship with the primal elements, a connection so close it's as if they stand in two worlds: that of mortals, and that of raw elemental power. They channel this rage into themselves to call forth the spirits of rock and fire, wind and water, seeking their aid in battle.
	Dozens of elemental cults and priesthoods exist in the Tyr Region. For the most part, these cults are impoverished, weak, and mocked by city dwellers. However, the people who dwell in the villages and wastes have a different opinion of elemental priests. They regard them as holders of powerful and dangerous magic, to be respected or feared accordingly.
	Many elemental priests revere the nameless, formless principle of all living elements together, making no distinction between one manifestation over another. However, others give themselves to more specific examples of elemental power. For example, the Smoking Crown is home to dwarf priests who serve the spirit of the volcano, whereas the mountain known as An-Bezzumar, the Crown of Heaven, is sacred to goliath wind shamans. The wandering thrikreen mystics known as the Rainspeakers venerate the rare, blessed showers that fall a few times each year during the cooler months and often make pilgrimages to places where rain is soon to fall.
	Heroic elemental priests are leaders of the village and wasteland folk and potent enemies of the sorcerer-kings and their templars. They are often intermediaries who protect villagers by seeking to placate angry elemental manifestations or summon vanished ones to places where they are needed. Some elemental priests instead follow a monastic or ascetic tradition instead of the more common tribal or village traditions of elemental worship. Your character might therefore be a secret scholar or cultist indoctrinated in a hidden temple, or a semibarbaric elemental priest raised among the people of the wastes.
Creating: Elemental priests include wandering healers, mad hermits, secretive cultists, and grim warriors-any character who venerates the elemental spirits of Athas might become an elemental priest. Desert-dwelling dwarves, elves, goliaths, and humans become elemental priests to gain access to a few primal powers, and they identify themselves as servants of the desert spirits. Druids and sorcerers choose this theme to gain powers of healing and protection. Finally, many animist shamans are elemental priests, and they add the potent conjurations of this theme to their own powers.

Life under the sorcerer-kings is hard. Water, food, and shelter are never guaranteed, and one misstep can result in a public flogging by an overambitious templar or a swift execution to serve as warning to others who might overstep their bounds. But the sorcerer-kings know that even with loyal templars and vast armies at their command, they rule with their subjects' consent. To distract the masses from their misery, to divert public attention from oppressive laws and heavy taxes, the sorcerer-kings decree the incessant spectacle of gladiatorial games.
	Each city-state boasts an impressive arena, with enough seating to hold most of its citizens. Each week, or more often depending on weather or political conditions, nobles and commoners gather to watch the drama unfold, cheering madly as their favorite warriors duel with other gladiators, work in teams to claim the contest's great prize, or fight en masse to defeat whatever new horror the arena masters have plucked, no doubt at great expense and loss of life, from the desert wastes.
	Naturally, most gladiators are slaves. Chosen for this fate because of their strength or skill, they live and die at the crowd's favor, pitting what training they acquire against myriad foes, never knowing when they will face an insurmountable foe, never sure when their opponent will be their equal. Arena masters understand that their warriors fight with passion when they have something to fight for, and so they offer freedom, wealth, pleasure, or some other incentive to stoke the fires and keep their captive warriors eager for victory. Freedom is the greatest prize, of course-but the games are so violent that few gladiators live long enough to earn the victories they need to escape.
	The life of a gladiator is brutish and brief, but it is the one occupation a slave can hold that also brings respect. Gladiators are heroes to the common people. Their trials and victories are the stuff of legend, and many slaves grow comfortable from the accolades their conquests bring.
Creating: Some gladiators are born to the arena, raised from an early age to fight in front of the crowd. Others find themselves in the pit through no intention of their own-sentenced for a crime or sold into slavery, perhaps-only to discover that they were meant for the blood-soaked sands. A few individuals volunteer to fight in the arena, desperate (or cocky) enough to risk life and limb for a purse of high value.
	The gladiator theme is a common choice for fighters, battleminds, and other defenders. The theme powers offer several good options for establishing control over enemies in close combat, a useful talent for any defender. In addition, any tough melee combatants-for example, barbarians or melee rangers-interested in locking down enemies in melee can benefit from these powers.

Within the city-states, noble castes own more land and more slaves than anyone except the sorcererkings. The members of this social class are largely ineffectual puppets who have no real power, and only rarely do they muster the courage to oppose the plans of the sorcerer-kings. Even when they do so, it's not for the greater good. Most nobles watch out only for their own interests. They care nothing about what happens to people of lower castes, with the possible exception of people they own.
	Though nobles lack true power, they gain many advantages due to their wealth. Nobles can read and write and can easily acquire food and water, which isn't true for much of the Athasian population. Every noble receives a basic education in psionics, either through a school or from a tutor hired by the noble's family, learning an array of psionic talents to better defend himself or herself against enemies or to command minions. Most lose interest in their training and fall into the same decadent malaise that pervades the noble caste. Only a rare few nobles fully develop their psionic talents, but those who do so are among the most capable and dangerous practitioners of the Way.
Creating: Usually, nobles who become adventurers do so after being expelled (or removing themselves) from society. Your character might be a fugitive hiding from assassins working for other noble families or for the templars, a combat leader for your house who seeks new troops or more combat experience, or a rebel who left a noble family because he or she felt sympathy for common people.
	Power Points: If you choose a noble adept attack power of level 3 or 7 instead of a nonaugmentable encounter attack power at that level, you also gain 2 power points. If you do so with a power of level 13 or 17, you instead gain 4 power points, and if you do so with a power of level 23 or 27, you instead gain 6 power points. If you later relinquish your noble adept attack powers through retraining, you lose the power points you gained from the earlier choice.

Much of Athas is desolate and defiled, but the life of a world is difficult to quench altogether. In spite of the supernatural ruin visited over so much of the planet thousands of years ago, the vital force of Athas still flourishes in a few places-the rain-misted jungles of the Forest Ridge, the green palm groves of hidden oases in the Tablelands, the majestic stands of giant cactus that dot the stony barrens in the wilds south of Tyr, creek-fed mountain vales, the dazzling blue waters of the Dragon's Bowl, and a thousand more secret refuges and lost springs.
	Across the Tyr Region, sentinels stand watch over these surviving treasures, protecting them from pillaging or defiling at the hands of people too careless, desperate, or wicked to care whether their actions might murder one more piece of a gravely wounded world. These watchers and sentinels are the world's primal guardians, chosen by the spirits or selfappointed to defend the life of Athas.
	Many primal guardians are hermits who live in or near the lands they guard. Legendary druids such as Enola, the mul guardian of the Dragon's Bowl, and Mearedes, the protector of the island of Shault, are excellent examples. Some of these individuals choose their tasks for themselves, freely taking up the mantle of guardianship over some rare and precious verdant patch hidden in the desert. Others are possessed by the primal spirits, haunted or maddened by visions and bound to the place of the land's need. Still other primal guardians belong to circles or brotherhoods collectively sworn to defend a wide area. Several such circles, consisting mostly of halfling druids and wardens, are scattered throughout the Forest Ridge. Another band known as the Crescent Circle works to defend the Crescent Forest between Gulg and Nibenay. Finally, a few circles are free-roaming orders or societies that keep watch over the whole of the Tyr Region, passing messages to each other and gathering to oppose great dangers when they arise.
	Even if a primal guardian chooses a single locale to protect, he or she is free to wander the rest of the world. In fact, many guardians begin their careers with an extended time of wandering, learning the secrets of nature's balance throughout Athas and searching for the place of their calling. But even after this time comes to an end, the needs of all of Athas often draw a primal guardian into long journeys away from the place he or she wards.
	Even more so than elemental priests, primal guardians are people of the deep desert and the remote wilderness. Where the elemental priests seek to instill reverence for the primal elements in the peoples of Athas, primal guardians seek to keep verdant lands hidden and unspoiled. Some conceal trails or wield magic to obscure their warded places, some lure dangerous beasts to lair in the right spot, some spread rumors of death and desolation, and a few kill anyone who comes across the place they are sworn to protect. A few lives are nothing when weighed against the life of the world, after all.
Creating: Druids, shamans, barbarians, rangers, and wardens are most likely to become primal guardians. They are already attuned to the primal spirits, and they can easily see the worth in defending a place where nature still flowers. Likewise, rangers and preservers-including sorcerers, wizards, and fey pact warlocks-are often close to nature and dedicated to its defense. However, the primal spirits sometimes move through unexpected heroes.

Judges, officials, and enforcers of the king's laws, templars are the embodiment of civic authority in the great cities of Athas. They form a privileged meritocracy of individuals who serve as the sorcerer-king's eyes, ears, and mouth among the populace-and, as circumstances require, the heavy hand of crushing tyranny. Given broad discretion to enforce the king's will as they see fit, templars are often brutal and corrupt, using their positions to wring ruinous taxes and bribes from all who fall under their power. A sorcerer-king doesn't care about templars being corrupt, as long as they keep the city in good order.
	Templars commonly enjoy broad powers to arrest wrongdoers, impose fines, and command soldiers or city guards to do their bidding in their home cities. Of course, higher-ranking templars can countermand these orders, so a low-ranking templar can't just commandeer the half-giants guarding a city gate and march off into the desert with them-he would have to appeal to his superiors to approve his mission and request that guards be assigned to his command. Likewise, templars of a particular city-state have no civic authority in other cities or in places not under the direct rule of their king. Though the civic powers granted to templars are formidable in their own right, templars are not simply bureaucrats-many are also formidable spellcasters, sanctioned to wield the terrible magic of the sorcerer-kings in the pursuit of their duties. In many cities templars are trained in arcane magic in formal academies and are bestowed with the ability to call upon their sorcerer-king's magical might through lengthy pacts.
	The exact ranks and customs of the templar hierarchy vary widely from city to city. In Balic, templars are known as praetors and are elected to their positions (although a few elections end in unexpected upsets). The templars of Nibenay are exclusively female and are ceremonially wedded to the sorcererking. In Draj, templars are known as the Priests of the Moon and are charged with observing the civic worship of the king Tectuktitlay, who claims to be a god. Notwithstanding specific customs, all templars constitute a powerful, wealthy social class within their cities-a social class highly invested in keeping each sorcerer-king the supreme master of his or her city-state.
	Most templars revel in their positions and ruthlessly exploit the weak and the poor. However, a few are patriots who are truly concerned with what's best for their city and their fellow citizens. Some are reformers who seek to moderate the excesses of the system, and a rare handful are rebels seeking to effect change from within. Heroic templars likely hold these convictions.
Creating: All templars are members of the templar hierarchy and have some skill in the use of arcane magic-especially magic that is useful in compelling obedience or punishing lawbreakers. However, a templar need not be a member of a spellcasting class. A templar might be a rogue who serves as a spy or an investigator, a psion jurist or scholar, a warlord who holds a post as a commander or an administrator, or even a fighter who serves in an elite palace guard.

Arcane spellcasters are feared and reviled throughout Athas, but a secret society protects those who choose the path of the preserver: the Veiled Alliance. Cells of this cabal are located across the Tyr Region, mostly within the city-states. Each cell is independent and does not answer to any central authority. Leaders of each cell oversee and train a network of warriors, spies, and other capable agents-especially those who use arcane power.
	All Veiled Alliance activities are directed toward the protection of preserving and the downfall of defiling. Although individual members might take up other tasks, the organization holds no other purpose as more important. The boldest of these aims is direct opposition to the sorcerer-kings. The Alliance is therefore a rebel movement-the only rebel movement worth speaking of in some cities. As such, members of the Veiled Alliance are eagerly hunted by the templars and agents of every surviving sorcerer-king and those who wish to curry their favor.
	Any preserver who comes to the attention of the Veiled Alliance earns a degree of aid. Membership is another matter. A potential recruit must be trustworthy and gain sponsorship of an existing member.
	The Veiled Alliance holds the following tenets:
	• Protect the path of arcane preserving, its practitioners, and those who support preservers-especially the Veiled Alliance itself. Teach, aid, and liberate preservers and their allies. Do nothing that brings danger to a preserver's door.
	• Defilers are abominations that steal that which rightly belongs to everyone. In their weakness, they ruin the land and bring hostile attention to those who use arcane magic properly. Convert a defiler to the right path, or thwart and destroy the defiler without revealing the Alliance.
	• The greatest defilers, the sorcerer-kings, must be brought down. Only they have the power to destroy our path.
Creating: Most Veiled Alliance characters are preservers-sorcerers, wizards, and occasionally warlocks who have sworn never to defile and to do everything in their power to protect fellow preservers and safeguard knowledge that otherwise might pass from the world. However, not all Veiled Alliance members are primarily spellcasters. It's not unusual for an Alliance cell to include a sprinkling of psions, ardents, and other people of psionic talent, as well as spies and guards who have no magical talent at all. Veiled Alliance agents come from all classes, and some never master anything more than a taste of arcane power.

Civilization huddles behind the towering walls of the Seven Cities, citizens and slaves alike subject to the tyrannical sorcerer-kings and their power-mad templars. Life in the dusty streets of the cities might be easy compared to the harsh barrens of Athas, but the comfort and security the sorcerer-kings offer come at a terrible price. Freedom is just a dream, and countless thousands endure crushing poverty and injustice because it is the only way they know how to live. Only in the wide deserts and trackless wastelands beyond the grasp of the sorcerer-kings' rule can people truly be free. The nomads' lives are hard, but they are theirs to lead-or spend-as they see fit.
	The Tyr Region is home to hundreds of wandering bands of herders, hunters, and scavengers eking out hardscrabble lives from the deserts. Nomadic tribes roam the stony barrens and crisscross the sandy wastes as they follow kank herds or seek out new water sources. Owing no allegiance to any but themselves, they are the only Athasians (other than the recently freed people of Tyr) who know freedom's sweet taste. Many nomadic tribes have rejected the city-states for generations, surviving despite the hardships by learning the desert's secrets and mastering the survival techniques needed to provide the bare essentials.
	In addition to those who are born to the nomadic life, there is no shortage of fugitives from the cities who hope to join them. Deserters, escaped slaves, and other refugees flee their homelands and the fate they would face if they stayed, preferring to risk their lives in the certain hardship and probable death the wastelands promise. Some find new homes alongside the nomadic tribes. Others go it alone, becoming hermits. But the desert claims most, with thirst, hunger, and exposure taking their toll until nothing remains but a slow, lingering death. Those who survive this grim test of survival are the toughest, the strongest, and the most willing to do what they must to meet whatever struggle they face.
	The sorcerer-kings loathe the wasteland nomads, seeing them as nothing more than rabble and brigands who thieve and murder to make ends meet. In their eyes, the nomads are a cancer, weakening the sorcerer-kings' legitimate governments. Nomad tribes must contend not only with the environment, but also with the city-states' armies and patrols, which range the lands to round up new slaves to toil or fight or die, depending on the templar who seizes them. For this reason, and of course the never-ending quest for food and water, nomads must stay on the move.
Creating: You come from the deadly lands beyond the Seven Cities, and you derive power from the primal energy that still thrives in those regions. Barbarians, seekers, and other primal characters are common among the wasteland nomads, but heroes of any power source can emerge from the deserts of Athas. Rangers and rogues rely on their tricks and talents for survival. Monks appreciate the solitude of the wild. Ardents, battleminds, and psions perfect their mental disciplines away from the rule of the sorcerer-kings.

Throughout the world, from city-states to slave tribes to nomadic clans in the wastes, people spontaneously develop psionic abilities. Without formal training, these wilders manifest blunt, simple disciplines. Though well-trained savants scoff at the crudeness of the wilders' techniques, they are well aware of how powerful an unleashed mind brimming with psionic energy can be. Some wilders create bursts of fire or magical force, making their thoughts incarnate. Others batter through their enemies' mental defenses and cause grievous psionic anguish. A wilder isn't limited solely to outward manifestations of power, though. Many first learn how to alter their own bodies to make them far tougher, quicker, or stronger than normal. Wilders are most potent when they harness “psychic surges,” brief flashes of psionic energy that ripple through their minds and temporarily heighten their psionic abilities.
	In the city-states, people see wilders as dangerous and unreliable. All too often an untrained wilder uses his or her ability against unsuspecting neighbors, or loses control of a power barely held in check-with disastrous consequences. In many cities, templars scour the children of nobles and commoners alike for signs of psionic power, and see to it that these discoveries are carefully trained to control their gifts and guard against disaster. Outside the cities, it's a different story. The psychic surges that wilders manifest are simply another advantage in the fight for survival in the savage lands outside the sorcererkings' domains. Each tribe treasures any wilders that appear within its ranks. As long as they help out, they're treated well.
	Becoming a wilder requires no formal training. In fact, trying to control and develop psychic surges can cause those powers to function poorly. A wilder might practice blasting rocks to learn how to manifest his or her inherent disciplines quickly and in the right spot, but that's all there is to it. Concentration is vital to a wilder, but mentors and formulas are worthless.
Creating: Anyone who manifests natural psionic ability without needing training could be a wilder. Wilders appear in all places and among all social strata. Your character might be a slave or a gladiator who has unnatural durability and stamina, a noble who got a head start on your psionic education by using your psychic surge, or a tribal leader who won a high place among your people by demonstrating your psionic powers.

Masters of a rare and ancient discipline, alchemists study the properties of mundane and magical ele-ments. They are keen observers of the physical world, and many alchemists have extensive interests in fields of knowledge ranging from astronomy to zoology.
  Although many wizards find the study of alchemy rewarding, not all alchemists are wizards. Alchemy does not require the casting of spells or the use of arcane power; the reagents provide all the magic that is necessary to create alchemical effects. Anybody who has a reliable formula, the necessary ingredients, and the specialized knowledge to follow exacting instructions precisely can create alchemical substances and devices. For example, fighters and paladins sometimes study alchemy for its usefulness in siegecraft and military engineering, and rogues find many uses for smoke bombs, lock-eating acids, and sleeping powders.
  Experiment and experience are the alchemist's path to understanding, and the vast majority of alchemists maintain a large laboratory stocked with a huge variety of tools and reagents. Alchemical laboratories are expensive, so most alchemists seek out a wealthy sponsor, such as a royal patron, or a civic commission. In some lands, sponsorship of a famous alchemist is a point of great pride, and rival cities or courts seek to entice alchemists of renown to establish workshops in the realm. Alchemists who have no royal patrons support their studies and experiments by producing mixtures that are useful to other artisans, or substances that have military (or criminal) applications. Unsponsored alchemists have less time or fewer resources available for pure experimentation, but they're also not hampered by meddling or inconvenient requests from the lord or lady holding the purse strings.
  Creating: Adventuring alchemists have little opportunity to establish large laboratories or conduct lengthy, involved experiments. However, they have a great advantage over alchemists who are settled in workshops: They frequently encounter rare and unusual materials that more sedentary alchemists have a hard time coming by, so they can create potent mixtures and substances with much smaller samples and simpler processes than alchemists who rely on more mundane materials. Armed with a "traveling workshop"-a large case filled with small samples of useful reagents, portable instruments, and working notes-an adventuring alchemist can prepare almost anything an ordinary alchemist might brew up in a full-sized workshop. Adventuring alchemists naturally keep their eyes open for interesting materials, and they constantly restock their cases with quick scrapings or samples from the things they see as they go about their explorations.

Gifted with an uncanny ability to befriend and train natural beasts, animal masters are often more at home with animals than with people. Anyone who lacks for humanoid companionship might adopt an animal as a friend and traveling companion, but animal masters aren't just collectors of pets-they're expert trainers and handlers who establish practical partnerships with their animal companions. Animals possess crucial senses and abilities that humans (and other civilized people) lack, and by working closely with a well-trained partner, animal masters gain the benefit of these senses and talents too.
  Although some who work with animals train large, ferocious creatures as battle companions, most animal masters work with common animals that are easily domesticated. Their companions are friendly toward or tolerate humans, and they have much more ability to learn complicated tricks and behaviors than truly wild animals do. Heroes interested in keeping panthers, bears, wolves, or other large carnivores to tear their foes to pieces belong in the druid or ranger classes, where they can learn the appropriate powers and acquire dangerous wild beasts to aid them in battle.
  Creating: Animal masters include members of most classes. Fighters, paladins, and other warriors find that the keen senses of loyal animals are very useful for avoiding ambushes and keeping watch over camp at night. Other adventurers keep animals for less noble purposes; some rogues train small, clever animals as effective burglars or thieves. However, rangers are the most common animal masters. These individuals are often loners, and they have a knack for befriending all sorts of nondangerous animals.

Great wizards are forged, not born. Natural talent and a quick mind are only the bare beginning of being able to wield the arcane arts. Achieving true mastery requires personal dedication and self-discipline, rigorous training, and access to libraries full of ancient grimoires and crumbling scrolls. In many places no special organizations or traditions exist to guide wizards and other arcane spellcasters along their way; magic-users come to their full powers and wield their spells as they see fit. But in other lands, magic is regarded as too important-or too dangerous-to be left in the hands of the self-taught dabblers. In these lands, magic is taught and practiced by members of special orders, guilds, societies, brotherhoods, and cabals who jealously guard access to their powers and seek to control their use.
  Arcane orders arise for many reasons. Some exist for the purpose of preserving arcane traditions and instructing new spellcasters in arcane powers. Others organize the efforts of their members in the service of a worthy (or sometimes not so worthy) cause. For example, the Order of the Golden Flame is sworn to serve the crown of Cernall, and its members are granted extensive authority as royal officers. The Ruathar Eldoni is an order of eladrin wizards dedicated to the destruction of demons, its members traveling throughout the world and beyond it to deal with demonic incursions wherever they appear. The Emerald Orb is a meddlesome cabal whose members believe that wizards should rule over lesser mortals, and they work to gain influence over important rulers or to establish open magocracies. Some orders are large, formal hierarchies in which members are expected to obey the orders of their superiors, whileothers are small fellowships in which no one member is considered superior to his or her fellows.
  An arcane order might operate openly or exist as a hidden society. Members of openly active orders typically proclaim their allegiance with a highly recognizable garment or symbol; for example, wizards of the Golden Flame wear a richly embroidered yellow cloak, and members of the Ruathar Eldoni often wear a silver star-shaped brooch or clasp. Other orders favor such identifiers as tattoos, unique hairstyles or grooming, or implements of a particular design. Members of secret orders avoid any outwardly distinguishing signs, of course, but often have secret signs they can use to prove their identity to others of their group-for instance, a pendant worn under one's shirt, a ring that isn't very obvious to a casual viewer, or a brand hidden beneath robes.
  Creating: Most order adepts are, of course, wizards or warlocks. Members of both classes rarely appear in the same order, but both have traditions of gathering in secret societies that share a common vision. In addition, many orders include individuals who supplement their studies in arcane magic with other talents. Clerics devoted to gods of magic or battle mages who find that the swords and armor of the fighter are the tools that suit them best can be members in good standing of an arcane order. Sometimes members of other classes begin their careers as aspiring wizards before abandoning their studies. For the rest of their lives they carry the memories (and perhaps disappointments) of their youthful studies, and still find uses for the little bit of arcane magic they did learn before they left or were dismissed.

Apprentices exist in any trade, of course, but none are more famous-or infamous-than wizards' apprentices. Stories tell of foolish apprentices stealing peeks at books that should not be opened, fumbling love charms, or botching transmutations by treating dangerous magic as a clever toy. Other tales recall clever apprentices who come up with just the right spell to save a village while their masters are away, or boldly putting their lessons to good use as they set out in search of adventure. Whether they turn out to be rash or resourceful, wizards' apprentices begin their careers with a priceless advantage: the personal instruction and tutelage of an experienced master.
  In exchange for the privilege of learning magic, wizards' apprentices normally spend years engaged in whatever drudgery and chores their masters deem fitting. A typical human wizard's apprentice begins his or her studies around the age of eleven or twelve and remains in the master's household for five or six years. Experienced spellcasters can take on apprentices for a variety of reasons: to share their appreciation of the art, to repay the work of their own masters by instructing a worthy student, or to tutor a young noble. Surprisingly, many of the most reclusive or suspicious-even evil-spellcasters take on apprentices; some regard it as their duty to pass along their learning, some hope to shape talented young mages into future allies (or minions), and others desire an audience to witness the brilliance of their schemes. Evil masters are often callous or exacting, but only the stupidest are actively sadistic toward their apprentices; after all, it's not wise to share secrets of power with someone you've caused to hate you.
  Adventuring wizards' apprentices are usually young adults whose training is more or less complete. They no longer live in their masters' households, and they aren't obligated to wash floors or scrub pots between lessons. Assuming such an individual parted from his or her master on good terms, the apprentice has at least one knowledgeable patron willing to offer advice and assistance in important matters. Many wizards' apprentices retain their loyalty to their masters throughout their lifetimes, even if they surpass their masters' achievements. Apprentices who were taught by particularly powerful or famous masters can serve as agents and allies of those mentors, and they see themselves as the appointed guardians of a long and honored tradition. Just as noble families have ancestral lines going back centuries, many famous spell casters likewise come from lines of apprentice-master relationships tracing back to famous wizards or sorcerers of old.
  Creating: Most apprentices are arcane spellcasters-warlocks or wizards. Both classes boast long traditions of passing on knowledge to a single chosen student at a time to ensure that only those who prove themselves competent and responsible are taught the ways of magic. However, many would-be students of the arcane choose not to follow in their masters' footsteps. For example, a young ne'er-do-well might toil over lessons and chores in the home of the town's sorcerer, only to abandon his or her master and take up a career as a rogue who happens to know a fair bit of arcane magic from years of indentured servitude. Wealthy nobles often arrange tutors for their children, providing the basics of an arcane education even if the youngsters turn to other pursuits when they become adults. Almost anyone might have studied magic before he or she became an adventurer.

Ordained priests are characters who are formally appointed to work in the service of a faith, a sect, or a system of worship. Although some are devout wielders of divine power, many have no magical abilities at all; the term "ordained priest" in this context means someone who holds the social position or occupation of being an ordained official of the faith. For example, typical village priests have no powers comparable to the attack and utility prayers of adventuring clerics. They hold a different sort of power: the deference of their neighbors, the trust of the authorities, and the respect of the great majority of the citizenry who rely on their counsel and good judgment. Ordained priests might serve as teachers, soldiers, confessors, advisors, students, magistrates, or powerful rulers, but whatever their role in society, they inspire and influence ordinary people to live up to the standards of their faith.
  Ordained priests enjoy a bewildering variety of preferred titles. Depending on the land in which they're found and the faith to which they belong, they might be known as curates, elders, friars, imams, lamas, prelates, shepherds, rectors, or vicars. In some realms, temples are huge, powerful states within the nation, ruling over wide estates guarded by armies of temple guards. Ordained priests in rich, influential hierarchies such as these might have duties or titles that have little to do with ministering to commoners, and instead they could wield authority as judges, lawkeepers, and bureaucrats. However, most faiths in the mortal world are smaller organizations that rarely have much influence outside their own realm or kingdom.
  Creating: Although ordained priests aren't always clerics (or paladins, or adventurers of any sort), it's not unusual for clerics or other heroes to be ordained priests. Ordained priests are educated by the standards of their homelands, plus they are influential and responsible. When difficult challenges or threats arise, rulers often consult with local priests and seek their advice about how to proceed. Some ordained priests are content to offer their counsel, but others more inclined to action might set out to solve problems personally, eventually taking up a career in adventuring. Naturally, adventuring ordained priests are often clerics. Druids also serve as members of the priesthood in some cultures and are a good fit for this theme. Rogues or fighters might also serve as ordained priests, employing guile or strong sword arms in the service of their faith.

For some, the past is dead and buried, but any adventurer who has ever set foot in a trap-filled, ancient tomb or battled a terrible demon freed from some centuries-old binding knows that what happened long ago might be of crucial importance to those living in the present day. Scholars study the lore of ancient times, collecting old texts and ferreting out forgotten secrets. They seek to preserve the memories of bygone days and pass along to future generations the important lessons the past offers. As with any dungeon-delving adventurers, they are keenly interested in dormant perils and lost treasures, but scholars are just as interested in the most ordinary details of ancient realms and events. To scholars, knowledge is its own reward.
  Not all cultures or societies value the musty old tales of ancient days. For many people, the study of history-or simple literacy-is an extravagance. Scholars are highly specialized professionals, and their services are not in great demand. The typical frontier town or farming village has no library or formal schooling. As a result, scholars are found only in places where books and records are collected. Large cities sometimes feature vaults or libraries dedicated to scholarship, and they might have colleges or guilds of scholars who study in them. However, large collections of books are more typically the prized possessions of temples dedicated to deities of knowledge and civilization (such as Ioun or Erathis), or of powerful noble families. Most scholars are therefore sponsored or supported by a temple or patron, and they seek to repay their benefactors by adding to their collections throughout their careers.
  Creating a Scholar: Adventuring scholars are most often wizards, since the study of the arcane arts appeals to the same sort of intelligent, meticulous individual that scholarship does. Arcane secrets are buried in ancient tomes and hidden in myth and legend much like the secrets of history and other fields of learning. Clerics also make good scholars-especially clerics devoted to deities of knowledge or magic. Any cleric of Ioun or Erathis is likely something of a scholar already. Warlocks also know the value of ancient lore, but in their traditions, knowledge is regarded as something to hoard and conceal; most warlocks are cryptic and obscure at best. Fighters, rogues, paladins, and rangers are not likely to follow the scholar's path, preferring action to contemplation. However, some heroes might have been raised to be scholars only to choose a different walk of life later. For example, a young scholar lured by the idea of unearthing forgotten hoards might become an exceptionally well-educated rogue who specializes in plundering ancient crypts

Gifted with unusual abilities to perceive things hidden by distance or uncertainty, seers are prized as advisors by powerful people throughout the world. They might call themselves astrologers, fortunetellers, readers, augurs, diviners, or soothsayers, and each employs a favored technique for prognostication. Many seers choose to complicate their viewings with flamboyant mummery designed to impress ordinary people and perhaps conceal the important secrets of their trade. But despite the confusing mystical trappings, seers aren't frauds. Their second sight is a real and powerful gift, even if it is fickle at times.
  The ability to anticipate success or failure in great endeavors, to determine the most auspicious times to embark on risky ventures, or to read the secret motives of others is a valuable edge. Naturally, wealthy patrons seek out famous and successful seers so that they can gain advantage over their rivals. Retained as permanent advisors and paid generously for their services, these kept seers are at the top of their profession. Kept seers enjoy unusual access to those they serve, and they can become entangled in the petty rivalries and battles for influence that pervade most courts and noble households. To minimize such entanglements, some rulers choose to sequester their magical advisors, keeping them out of the reach of courtiers or rivals who might harbor ambitious schemes. Other seers embrace their role as important figures in the court. Competent seers with this sort of position are placed well to do great good, but they can also do serious harm if they provide their masters with inept advice or engage in disloyal behavior. After all, a "trusted" wizard has deposed more than one king.
  Seers who have not yet attracted a wealthy patron or established a reputation for success settle for a meager living catering to commoners, casting fortunes for a few coppers or silvers at a turn. Ordinary people often seek the advice of augurs and diviners when contemplating major business decisions, choosing a time to travel, arranging marriages, naming a child, or seeking explanations for some sort of misfortune. In a bustling city, well-respected seers with a wealthy clientele can make a comfortable living. Seers from small or backward towns might be little better than peddlers and beggars, hard-pressed to feed themselves from day to day-a situation that makes it hard to convince potential customers that one's powers offer useful insights. Adventuring seers fall somewhere between the extremes of royal advisor or marketplace fortune-teller; they rarely settle down in the service of a single patron, but in time their spreading fame ensures that many will come to seek their advice.
  Creating a Seer: To invoke useful visions, seers require natural talent (their gift, whatever form it takes) and ability with the magical arts. Minor spells help many seers to direct their ability. Consequently, adventuring seers are usually wizards or warlocks. Some techniques for readings and visions are divine in nature rather than arcane, so clerics are also common as seers. Cleric seers are often revered as prophets or interpreters of dreams whose visions are gifts of the gods. Seers of other classes are uncommon at best, although a few brazen rogues have been known to use the seer's trappings to implement schemes and scams of all sorts.

Dedicated to the ideals of chivalry, chevaliers are gallant warriors who serve as champions and exemplars to the people around them. A chevalier's personal honor is his or her most treasured possession; it is far better to die with honor than to live without it. Chivalric codes vary from race to race and culture to culture, but most agree on a number of noble virtues that all chevaliers should aspire to: courage, fairness, mercy, justice, loyalty, honesty, charity, piety, moderation, and gallantry.
  Although chevaliers strive to cultivate all the chivalric virtues, the most important elements of their code revolve around behavior on the field of battle. Honor demands that chevaliers seek out the most worthy foes on the field to defeat in a fair fight. Chevaliers aren't under any requirement to stand and die against superior foes-but they must stand as long as they hold out any hope for victory, and they need to execute a fighting retreat rather than flee in panic if the battle is hopeless. Likewise, chevaliers strive to fight fairly. Flanking foes or attacking dazed enemies is fair enough, especially if the enemy has the advantage of numbers, but performing a coup de grace or attacking a stunned foe is not honorable. Some chevaliers might wait for enemies that have fallen prone to stand again before resuming combat, or to permit a respite if a foe requests one. Of course, enemies who refuse to fight in a chivalrous manner fall outside the protections of honor and should be dealt with in the most expedient manner available.
  Chevaliers frequently come from well-born families. Many chivalrous traditions arise from the requirements of elite military social classes, such as heavily armored cavalry and highly trained sword fighters. Acquiring the specialized equipment and years of training needed to serve as their realms' most highly prized warriors-whether that warrior ideal is a human knight, a dwarf giant-slayer, or an eladrin bladesinger-is never cheap or easy. In some lands, aspiring heroes aren't permitted to become chevaliers unless they can prove their noble birth and thus their right to claim the privileges of knighthood, but in most places low-born warriors of skill and personal integrity can win their spurs through the sponsorship of royal patrons or their performance on the battlefield. No one denies that chevaliers are prone to more than a little haughtiness toward those they perceive as their social inferiors, but even the prickliest among them are conscious of their obligation to protect the weak and the poor from those who would oppress them.
Creating a Chevalier: A number of chevaliers are fighters (and most of those are knights), but other heroes also feel drawn to this gallant path. Many paladins and warpriests become chevaliers, dedicating themselves to upholding the chivalric virtues as they confront evil. Among elves and eladrin, ranger chevaliers aren't uncommon; elven chivalry does not disdain ranged weapons or the use of magic. Likewise, tiefling hexblades sometimes become "dark chevaliers," unleashing their warlock powers only against enemies who have demonstrated that nothing less will do.

Members of elite societies or military orders dedicated to the preservation of a worthy ideal, guardians are vigilant warriors ready to defend their sworn charges with their lives. Although strength and fighting spirit are useful to guardians, most pride themselves on using their heads, not their hands. Guardians believe that the service they offer doesn't permit personal glory-seeking or needless risk-taking. If the causes or the people they protect can be defended only by head-on battle, then guardians do not hesitate to draw their weapons. On the other hand, if the best way to carry out a mission is to employ stealth or subterfuge, or flee the scene, so be it.
  A guardian's orders vary widely from realm to realm. Some exist to protect another group or organization, such as the high priests of a particular god, the members of a wizards' guild, or a family line harboring a great destiny or a magical legacy. Some are sworn to protect a rare or treasured site or item, such as the forge-flame burning eternally in the heart of a dwarven citadel, or a mighty artifact of good that a demon lord seeks so that it can destroy the item. A few guardian orders are mercenary squads of the highest quality, priding themselves on offering the best, most loyal protection that gold can buy. However, most guardians are sworn to the service of a kingdom or realm. They serve as bodyguards to the royal family and high-ranking members of court, protect the treasures and the secrets of the realm, and undertake missions of vital interest to the crown.
Creating a Guardian: Characters who specialize in melee combat make the best guardians. Fighters and paladins are naturally strong candidates for this theme, since they combine good close-combat capabilities with excellent durability-a vital characteristic, since guardians must be ready to take an arrow for their charges if that's what the situation demands. Militant clerics likewise become guardians on occasion, protecting their wards with wise counsel as well as strength of arms. Rogues and rangers can also do well as guardians, since they can be less obvious than more heavily armed characters, and they have talents for circumventing avoidable dangers rather than battling through them.

Knight Hospitalers are members of a religious order of compassionate warriors sworn to provide care and comfort to the poor, the sick, and the injured. Their chapter houses are in many large cities, offering comfort and healing to those in need of it. However, Knight Hospitalers are most famous for their work out in frontier lands, where they aid travelers (especially religious pilgrims) who are in distress far from any other help. Fortified hospices stand near difficult mountain passes, at remote river crossings, and in lonely clearings in dark, monster-haunted forests. Many are the travelers whose lives have been saved by Knight Hospitalers watching over dangerous roads in the wilds.
  In addition to serving as healers and sponsoring almshouses and hospices throughout the land, Knight Hospitalers are valiant soldiers. Knight Hospitaler orders keep roads safe from bandits and monsters, especially routes used by pilgrims journeying to holy sites. They defend important shrines and protect high-ranking members of the priesthood. Finally, Knight Hospitaler orders are the backbone of many crusading armies seeking to confront great evils in far lands.
  Like chevaliers, Knight Hospitalers are seen as knights of a sort and are entitled to a number of privileges in most realms. They are responsible for maintaining estates and strongholds, overseeing justice in their demesnes, and marshaling companies of soldiers to protect the lands around their estates. However, they are loyal to religious leaders, not secular rulers. Knight Hospitaler commanders hold high ecclesiastic rank as well as knightly titles and estates. In practice, most Knight Hospitalers split their time between the estates for which they are personally responsible and the chapter houses or hospices of their order. Titles and estates are awarded on the basis of seniority and family influence, so low-ranking Knight Hospitalers rarely have estates of their own. Instead they serve as seneschals or lieutenants to landed Knight Hospitalers, swear fealty to the king or high nobles of the nearest realm, or take up arms in a crusade.
Creating a Knight Hospitaler: Clerics of any kind and paladins are the backbone of Knight Hospitaler orders. Armed with potent healing abilities, they are well equipped to carry out the sacred mission of their societies. Fighters and rangers sometimes become Knight Hospitalers despite their lack of divine magic; Knight Hospitalers fight as well as heal, and Knight Hospitaler chapters offer excellent opportunities for brave, true warriors to win respect and renown.

Heroes arise from all levels of society. Some begin their stories as peasants, some as rough-and-ready homesteaders from frontier lands, and others as welloff townsfolk, but some heroes are born into privilege. Noble-born heroes enjoy opportunities and comforts that many commoners can only imagine, but if they are blessed with wealth and inf luence by the luck of being born to high station, then they are also obligated to do more with the gifts they have been given.
  The definition of nobility varies from land to land and race to race. In most realms, the aristocracy falls into three groups: low nobility, high nobility, and royalty. Low nobles include landed knights, squires, baronets, lairds, hidalgos, seigneurs, and other holders of minor titles and estates. Typically a low noble's lands rarely extend for more than a day's ride or include more than one good-sized town. Most low nobles owe allegiance to a nearby high noble, who might bear a title such as baron, count, duke, marquis, earl, landgrave, or prince. High nobles can be major powers, since they are wealthy enough to raise their own armies and are near-absolute rulers over the lands of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of low nobles. High nobles in turn owe their allegiance to the sovereign of their realm. Royal titles come in a bewildering variety, ranging from king or queen to archduke, high prince, tsar, khan, shah, or something even more exotic. Of course, the ranks of the nobility also include everyone in the titled landholder's family. A member of a noble family who isn't the actual titleholder is generally called lord or lady.
  An adventurer from a noble family is rarely the family's active titleholder or ruler. Governing and defending a fief is an important duty, and the affairs of the kingdom leave little time for dungeon delving and adventure seeking. Most noble heroes are therefore untitled lords or ladies who are closely related to a titleholder. A hero might be the heir apparent to the title of head of the family, standing only one heartbeat away from a noble seat, or he or she might be further removed from the order of succession, free to indulge a taste for adventure with little concern for ever becoming a baron, a duke, or a king.
  Regardless of whether they hold titles or might inherit them, nobles still enjoy a number of perquisites of their high stations. Common officials and lawkeepers can arrest or hinder nobles only in exceptional circumstances. Important people in nearby lands are careful to treat nobles with respect, even deference, for fear of offending a powerful family. Nobles are also wealthy by the standards of most people. As long as they're anywhere near home, nobles can afford fine meals, excellent lodgings, and sufficient allowances and stipends to maintain themselves in comfort.
Creating a noble: Noble heroes can be found in every character class. Naturally, knights are frequently born of noble families. Wizards can come from noble backgrounds, since noble families possess the means and the opportunity to arrange for promising youngsters who display an interest in magic to be tutored in the magical arts. Nobles blocked from inheriting titles by older siblings are encouraged to enter the clergy, and they might become clerics or paladins. Even a rogue could have an aristocratic origin; a street-savvy thief might be a troublemaker who became bored with a life of being pampered or a runaway seeking to avoid the duties of holding high rank.

Seekers of new lands and lost places, explorers are masters of the trackless wilderness. Formal exploration is not very common in the world; a few wealthy kingdoms and mercantile cities charter expeditions to distant lands or reward travelers who return home with descriptions of far-off places. Most explorers, however, are individuals whose interests or duties lead them to venture into places where other people rarely go. They can be hunters, scouts, pathfinders, merchants, or emissaries to distant realms. Pursuing their private interests or carrying out important missions entrusted to them leads these travelers into the wild places of the world.
Many explorers begin their adventures as professional treasure-seekers. Searching out legends about lost hoards, hidden artifacts, or unplundered tombs, they put their talents to use in locating the rich score that no one else has found. Other explorers are engaged in searches, quests, or missions that lead them to places no one has visited before. For example, an order of knights or wizards might charge its members with traveling the world to battle a specific threat. A few explorers are true wanderers-travelers who feel compelled to see for themselves what lies beyond the next ridge or to seek out legendary challenges. Fortune or fame is of little concern to these wanderers; they live to satisfy their personal curiosity or to measure themselves against the dangers they overcome.
Regardless of individual motivation, explorers must master a daunting set of skills if they hope to be successful. They must be tough and enduring, capable of traveling great distances over difficult terrain, and must have the ability to survive the worst extremes of weather. They must be expert beast hunters and foragers with a talent for living off the land no matter where they are, since they're not likely to find friendly inns or trading posts once they leave civilization behind. A knack for direction is indispensable; roads are nonexistent in the wilds, and missing an important landmark or choosing the wrong turn off a poorly marked trail might be a fatal mistake. Finally, explorers had better be ready to defend themselves from the attacks of vicious raiders and hungry monsters.
Creating an Explorer: The explorer theme works well with any character class. Rogues are drawn to this theme as treasureseekers; legends of vast hoards in lost cities or fantastic treasures hidden in deep caverns are the meat and drink of many bold rogues. Wizards take to the explorer's path for less materialistic reasons, drawn by the lure of knowledge and discovery. Rangers are perhaps the most iconic explorers. At home in the deepest wilderness, skilled in the hunt, capable and enduring, rangers are pathfinders and trackers of extraordinary skill. They can venture through wilderness that no other explorers could survive.

Heroes can rise from unfortunate circumstances, and few circumstances are less fortunate than to begin life as a penniless street urchin in a hard, unforgiving city. Orphaned, abandoned, or mistreated as children, guttersnipes can grow into hard-bitten, cynical adults. Marked by the lower-class manners and speech patterns of the poorest quarters, guttersnipe heroes struggle to be seen as something more than the dregs of society. Guttersnipes live their lives under constant suspicion from the more fortunate people in the world. Most are seen as greedy, lying cutpurses, footpads, or ruffians who would slit a throat for a handful of silver pieces. Common people openly distrust them, constables and watch officers routinely harass or question them, and aristocrats are surrounded by watchful guards or counselors who make it a point to keep the riffraff, especially dangerous riffraff, away.
Under this cloak of distrust, some guttersnipes choose to live down to others' expectations, nursing bitter grudges against their "betters." Others desperately try to escape their poor origin by concealing their street manners and lack of education behind carefully rehearsed facades of gentility; they dread the day when someone sees through the disguise. Some happy-go-lucky souls choose not to be troubled by suspicions and slights, refusing to be defined by others' ill-informed judgments. Finally, benefactors who see potential in them pluck a lucky few guttersnipes out of the streets and give them a chance to make something of themselves. A powerful wizard might detect a spark of greatness in a street urchin and teach the boy or girl a few tricks; a compassionate priest might offer a poor child a chance to become an acolyte in a temple. As recounted in more than one legendary tale, guttersnipes are sometimes picked up from the streets by royalty or high nobles and adopted after doing some great service or showing tremendous pluck.
Whether a guttersnipe meets life with wry wit or scheming self-interest, every one is a survivor who excels in recognizing and seizing opportunity. Guttersnipes who through good fortune or hard work leave the streets behind to become wizards, clerics, or wards of nobles might not look or sound much like the beggar children they once were, but inside they still have the quick wits and daring that got them noticed in the first place.
Creating a Guttersnipe: Naturally, a great number of rogues are guttersnipes; growing up in the streets provides a perfect opportunity for learning the rogue's talents. Fighters, especially slayers, also fit this theme well. Guttersnipes of exceptional talent sometimes turn to magic and master the warlock's art, determined to earn respect through power. Beyond that, characters of any class could be plucked from the streets or succeed in their efforts to improve their circumstances. A guttersnipe is most likely a human, dwarf, halfling, drow, or tiefling, since the lowborn folk of these races are most likely to congregate in the sort of poor, desperate slums from which guttersnipes come.

Sellswords, spellslingers, soldiers of fortune, freebooters-regardless of their appellation, mercenaries are heroes who work for pay. Capable warriors and spellcasters are always in demand, and the more desperately they're needed, the better paid they are. More than a few young heroes begin their careers by striking out in search of opportunities to turn their fighting skills into high-paying jobs. Although most people expect that mercenaries do only what they're paid to do, it's not unusual for a heroic mercenary to show a soft spot after coming across people in need who can't afford his or her services. It might not be good business, but one of the advantages of being unencumbered by loyalties and obligations is the ability to follow the dictates of one's conscience whenever they strike.
Each adventuring mercenary falls into one of two broad categories: retainer or freelancer. A retainer signs on with a patron, providing service in exchange for a regular stipend or salary. Nobles, merchants, and royal officials often find it useful to keep a small number of talented troubleshooters at their beck and call for escorting them during travels, guarding their homes or interests, or dealing sternly with rivals. Retainers are naturally expected to follow their employers' orders, but they spend less time looking for work.
A freelancer hires on for one specific job at a time or works on speculation-for example, hunting down outlaws who have prices on their heads or searching out prospective employers who have problems in need of fixing.
Mercenaries might be more flexible in their standards than high-minded characters who serve others without thought of reward, but that doesn't mean they'll do anything for money. Heroic mercenaries won't hesitate to walk away from jobs that require them to murder, rob, or oppress commoners. Likewise, the best mercenaries pride themselves on their loyalty and professionalism even under difficult conditions. Any thug can take a paymaster's gold to swagger around and look capable when danger's far away, but honest mercenaries don't slink off into the shadows when called upon to earn their pay. Building a reputation for having standards and being reliable is the best way to impress future employers. Some mercenaries, however, are little more than brigands who are perfectly happy to earn a living through plundering and banditry if they can't find more respectable work that pays them well enough. Heroic mercenaries therefore face a good deal of suspicion and prejudice from people who expect sellswords to behave like thugs.
Creating a Mercenary: Characters of any class might call themselves mercenaries, or at least make a habit of choosing their quests based on the likely rewards. Rogues and fighters naturally fit the mercenary's approach to adventure, and they often flourish as sellswords. Clerics and paladins can be driven by higher ideals than pure self-interest, but a devout or pious individual might nonetheless fall in with a company of freebooters.
Serving as voices of conscience and spiritual shepherds to their more worldly companions, they encourage their allies to take on causes that are both worthy and well paying. On the other hand, wizards can be every bit as avaricious as martial characters who sell their loyalties for gold. Ambitious nobles and powerful merchants find it useful to retain house wizards who can advise them on arcane matters, spy on rivals, and defend against the wizards employed by their rivals.

The world is a hard place. Many people are forced to do unfortunate things to survive; some are wrongly accused, and others find that the laws and structures that are meant to shield the weak from their depredations protect oppressors. Outlaw heroes are wanted by the authorities in their native realms. They risk arrest every time they show themselves, and they must develop a talent for disguise, take to a life in the wilderness, or master the art of the quick escape if they want to avoid the executioner's axe.
Outlaws might come to be outlaws for a variety of reasons. An insecure tyrant might decree the destruction of a noble family that poses a threat to his reign, leaving the survivors destitute and hunted by royal authorities. A tragic misunderstanding or accident might condemn an individual, who is discovered standing over a murdered archmage's body with a bloody dagger in her hand. No one believes her when she tries to explain that she found him already dead. In a realm where the powerful are free to oppress the weak, standing up to a cruel official or lord who injures or mistreats someone can easily turn a hero into an outlaw. However, it's far more common for an outlaw to justly stand condemned for her actions. She might be a habitual scofflaw who defies authority, or she might have made one tragic mistake in a moment of desperation or anger. Many paths can lead a person to earn a price on his or her head, and not all are undeserved.
Outlaw heroes often win the gratitude and loyalty of the poor people in the lands nearby, especially if they're standing up for commoners against oppressive rulers. In lands where the lawful authorities are weak or corrupt, outlaw heroes might be the only resource for defeating dangerous monsters and putting a stop to villainous plots. In addition, some officials and nobles deliberately cultivate contacts with capable outlaws. Sometimes it's useful to hire agents to do illegal things for good reasons . . . or for selfish ones. Ambitious nobles or courtiers often find employment for criminals and have ways to protect them from arrest or set them free again if they prove useful. Friends at court can make life much more comfortable for outlaw heroes.
Creating an Outlaw: Obviously, rogues are drawn to the outlaw's path; few rogues are ever in the law's good graces, even if they spend most of their time pilfering hoards in monster-haunted dungeons. Fighters and rangers are also well suited to the rigors of an outlaw's life, since they're tough and self-reliant. Clerics and wizards are less likely to be outlaws, but such a combination is not unheard of; a cleric who sees that the authorities are corrupt might be compelled by conscience to aid outlaws who resist injustice. Warlocks are often practitioners of arts frowned upon (or banned outright) by the powers that be, and they become accustomed to following their own paths regardless of the local laws.

Every adult Iron Wolf member considers himself or herself a warrior, taking pride in his or her bravery, tenacity, and stoicism in the face of pain or adversity. An Iron Wolf warrior learns the ways of the forest as a child, mastering arts of woodcraft and honing senses long forgotten by the so-called civilized folk of the world. Each soon-to-be Iron Wolf warrior trains alongside his or her tribal brothers and sisters, taking part in fierce skirmishes against orcs, giants, and other marauders, and learning how to fight and survive under the tutelage of the tribe's most honored warriors.
  As outsiders to the ways of civilization, Iron Wolf warriors are sometimes frustrated and confused by rules of behavior that make no sense to them. When one warrior has a quarrel with one another, he or she confronts that person. A brawl in the road (or, rarely, a duel to the death) is a perfectly acceptable way to settle such conflicts. These warriors value their given word highly, and they hold liars and cheats in utter contempt. Likewise, they have little patience for those who hold positions they did not earn through skill or valor, or who wield power they do not deserve.
Creating: The Iron Wolf people are human, so the vast majority of characters who choose this theme are human or part human. (In unusual circumstances, a character of any race might have been fostered among the Iron Wolf holds during his or her youth.) Barbarians are, of course, a natural fit for this theme, but many other characters can have a barbaric origin without actually being a member of the barbarian class. Fighters, hunters, rangers, scouts, slayers, and wardens are all appropriate as Iron Wolf members. Druids and shamans are also found among the Iron Wolf people. Character class doesn't limit access to this theme, because any character might have grown up as a member of the Iron Wolf tribe before undertaking class training in a different land-for example, a young Iron Wolf woman might travel to Vailin and become fascinated by arcane magic, or take up a career as a thief in the Free City of Zembar.

In many places, studying death, darkness, and peril is taboo. Most mortals fear what they cannot explain, including death. Those innovative souls who dare to actively seek out death's secrets learn that an entirely new realm of shadow awaits their discovery. Many temples and libraries include tomes on the subject of death. If someone had enough motivation and spent plenty of time researching, he or she could soon learn of the famed shadow mage Evard.
Evard, an enigmatic and potent practitioner of shadow magic, is a master of necromancy and nethermancy. His legacy is such that anyone who has spent time researching the Shadowfell has undoubtedly come across his most famous work, Legendry of Phantoms and Ghosts. This 800-page omnibus is one of the finest pieces of writing on the subjects of shadow magic, necromancy, and nethermancy. It covers everything from the creation of apparitions to details on their metaphysical construction and anatomy.
Those who learn of Evard and begin to study his work could become enthralled by all things related to the Shadowfell. Some who study Evard's works become recluses; others might seek to adventure in an effort to learn more of the Shadowfell and its inhabitants. On a research level, those seeking knowledge on these topics try to understand the breaching of the two planes of existence and learn how both sides interact with each other. As Evard noted, "You can never come to appreciate the fabric and essence of life without first knowing in full detail the beauty of death."	
Creating: Students of Evard are introverted, analytical individuals who study death and the afterlife. The succinct and deliberate way in which Evard's Legendry of Phantoms and Ghosts was written makes it seem more like a school textbook rather than something read for enjoyment. Students of Evard are inclined toward the scholarly classes, such as cleric, invoker, warlock, and wizard. Some martial classes study Evard's writings as well. Additionally, primal classes have great interest in becoming students of Evard due to their interest in spirits.

Gloomwrought, also known as the City of Midnight, is one of the few bastions of civilization within the Shadowfell. It is a place of treachery and subterfuge, where only the savvy survive. Unscrupulous political houses, whose special interests far outweigh the concerns of social needs, handle governance of the city while Prince Rolan the Deathless serves as the de facto leader. With all the political intrigue surrounding daily life within the city, many wealthy and powerful individuals ceaselessly work to expand their spheres of influence. One way in which they accomplish this is by sending out special envoys that work to further their interests and the interests of Gloomwrought. These Gloomwrought emissaries are crucial to the expansion of the city's political reach and are the eyes and ears of the noble houses.
Joining this elite corps of specialists can be difficult, and whom you know-not what you know-is important in most cases. In some cases, an existing agent of a house recruits emissaries passively by following them for some time and observing them from a distance so their skills and abilities can be gauged. This gives the recruiter time to evaluate and pass judgment before contacting the potential emissary and bringing him or her on board. In other cases, emissaries are cultivated from within the house and are trained from a young age, a method that has a high success rate in developing bright new talent.
Your life as a Gloomwrought emissary depends largely on the master you represent. You might serve as a crafty spy, or a hired assassin sent to eradicate an enemy of your house. You could serve Gloomwrought as a diplomat by using your silver tongue to help spur, or incite, bloody conflict. No matter how you choose to serve, you are an important part of the city's social landscape.
Creating: Most Gloomwrought emissaries are martial combatants: rangers, rogues, and sometimes fighters. These classes have the requisite skill and proficiency to engage opponents in close combat effectively. Because of their cunning and grit, many brutal scoundrel rogues are enlisted as information brokers. They can use their contacts to gain intelligence from others and pressure them into giving up information. Rangers are employed for their ability to traverse the dangerous landscape of the Shadowfell, seeking out other communities and conclaves. They are also adept at tracking those who might have fled the city, and they serve as respected bounty hunters.
For those characters who accept life as a Gloomwrought emissary, training begins immediately, and the path to completion is as dangerous as it is rigorous. Senior members of a house's diplomatic corps set up various trials and tests that must be mastered before a recruit can progress. Despite what is said otherwise, death and dismemberment are a cruel reality of some training missions that emissaries must undertake.

You were on patrol in the Underdark outside your home, beautiful and benighted Menzoberranzan, when betrayal came. As if directed by psychic command, your companions suddenly turned against you as one. Drow are treacherous by nature, but such a blatant and brutal attack could mean only one thing: Your house had fallen. You escaped with your life, but with no allies and no idea of what to do next.
	None survive alone in the wilds of the Underdark for long, and so your would-be killers assumed you to be dead-as you would have been if the members of Bregan D'aerthe had not found you. You had heard the tales of these drow mercenaries, of course-the much-derided and dishonorable castaways of other destroyed houses. When your benefactors confirmed that your kin had been annihilated, you expected them to show contempt for the weakness of your house and your own helplessness. Instead, they offered to induct you into their company-giving you a chance to restore the honor, the allies, and the home that had been taken from you.
	For decades, you have served as part of Bregan D'aerthe. As a part of the force sent to the surface to manipulate events in Luskan, you have watched that city's steady decline from den of piracy to cesspool of evil. You felt the tremors in the earth and saw the plume of black smoke to the south that marked Neverwinter's fall. During this time, Bregan D'aerthe continued to add to its coffers with missions for hire, but the opportunities for wealth grew slimmer as the danger in the North spread.
	Now, the mercenary drow have largely left the region, with only a few such as you remaining. You would have preferred to go with your fellows, but an order from Jarlaxle brought you instead to the ruins of Neverwinter. The sometime leader of Bregan D'aerthe gave you the task of investigating the forces at work in the city and the surrounding area-and, as always, to look for ways for Bregan D'aerthe to profit from others' plots. You have been told that someone-perhaps Jarlaxle himself-will come to you for information. Until then, you are on your own.
	You have learned that it doesn't pay to be without allies-even in the relative safety of the surface world. Few surface-dwellers have any compunctions about the death of a lone drow, particularly in the lawless North. Like Jarlaxle and the legendary Drizzt, you need to travel with others if you are to be successful in your goals.
Creating: When you choose to be a Bregan D'aerthe spy, you immerse yourself in the web of drow politics and the darkness of the race's culture. Though you have many options for making your character, only those with sharp blades and sharper wit can become one of the mighty Bregan D'aerthe.

The port city of Luskan squats along the northern frontier of the Sword Coast. It is a den of thieves and murderers that attracts criminals like moths to a bright-burning flame. Luskan is controlled by a consortium of gangs, war chiefs, and would-be rulers, few of which last more than a season.
	The Dead Rats are one of the exceptions.
	That thieves' guild has earned the respect and fear of the populace through a campaign of intimidation. Its members are known for their stealth, their ruthlessness, and their treachery. It is rumored-correctly-that the most deadly members of the gang are wererats. Like the creatures from which they derive their power, the Dead Rats can penetrate any safe house, no matter how secure. Initiation into the gang involves a blood ritual with one of these wererats, imbuing members of the guild with a sneaky and twitchy demeanor, particularly on nights of the full moon.
	Every member of the gang is fiercely loyal to a captain named Toytere-a halfling bard noted for his ability to see the future. Whether he truly possesses such sight or not, “King Toy” has never fallen to any of the attempts made to overthrow him. He has frequently rooted out would-be betrayers before they act, and he punishes anyone who attempts to leave the gang. However, your own split from the Dead Rats was a more complicated affair.
	It wasn't that your last job went bad. Not exactly. You made off with less than you expected, but like a good Rat, you gave over the one-quarter share due to King Toy and resolved to enjoy the rest. The next night, when you returned to your safe house, you were taken prisoner by wererat marauders and brought before King Toy. The halfling accused you of planning a mutiny and expected you to understand his need to purge his gang of disloyalty. His bodyguards drew their steel.
	Much blood was shed that night, but you escaped-barely alive and thanking Tymora for your good fortune. You fled Luskan, nigh penniless and with only the tools of your trade to your name. Your destination was the nearest safe haven you could manage-the comparatively civilized city of Neverwinter, several days' journey to the south.
	Exhausted, not knowing whom to trust, you thought at last that you had found somewhere to rest and ply your trade once more. Any good thief could spot the coin to be made or taken in this disorderly city. Perhaps your flight from Luskan was good fortune in disguise-you won't have the gang's dubious protection here, but you'll be free to keep all of your booty. Here you could build up wealth and power, and perhaps eventually return to Luskan to take your revenge on those who had wronged you.
	Well, that was your plan before you got here, anyway.

Throughout Faerûn's history, the North has ever been a breeding ground for cults, whether they serve devils, demons, or any of a thousand other dark masters. The last decades have grown progressively darker, presenting a great opportunity for cultists that promise protection from the terrors of the frontier-at the comparatively small cost of eternal loyalty and secrecy. Or so the stories and tales go.
	In reality, most of the cults that operate in the North have no deific connections, but are composed of indolent noble scions using the threat of darkness to gain romantic favor or to intimidate business rivals into closing up shop and skipping town. In such cults, young nobles claim to supplicate devils for the sake of their own jests, then drink themselves into oblivion while waiting for their servants to clean up the mess.
	You used to belong to one such false cult-or at least you thought you did.
	It seemed like a good idea at the time-allying with powerful individuals in Waterdeep in the mutual pursuit of authority, pleasure, and coin. Now, however, you've made a terrible mistake-one that you might end up paying for with your eternal soul.
	Although you come from a noble bloodline, you've never been particularly wealthy or influential. In the cult, however, you could rub shoulders with powerful and wealthy noble heirs who are excited to delve into the dark. You saw the potential in making important connections to your fellow noble scions, in the hope of securing a good marriage when you finally decided to settle down.
	At your infrequent rituals, celebrants would gather around braziers of white-hot coals and invoke the power of strangely named beings. Chanting would ensue, along with tedious and false religious mummery. Nothing ever came of these rites, of course, and each secret conclave would eventually devolve into the more important business of drinking, scheming, and hedonism. It all seemed harmless.
	Then one day, you were late for a meeting. When you arrived, it was to discover a ritual chamber covered in blood and gore. Your fellow cultists had been brutally dismembered as by a storm of ravaging claws and fangs. The central brazier burned with an unbelievably hot flame, drawing your attention. Enraptured, you stepped toward it, unable to resist. Fire flared, driving into your chest like a lance as it burned you, body and soul.
	When you awoke, it was in your own bed, far from the scene of the cult's massacre. You were happy to dismiss the memory as a nightmare-until you glimpsed a mark on your chest that made the nightmare real. You bear a crimson brand now-a sigil that you somehow recognize as the mark of Asmodeus. What it means, you have no idea-but the implications terrify you.
	Tricked, confused, and scared out of your mind, you fled Waterdeep for a place where you might hope to hide from those who know you. In N everwinter, you have spent uncounted days looking over your shoulder and dreaming of treachery, violence, and fire.
	You seek to gather allies to your side, fearful of what the power that binds you has in store. However, you hesitate to share your dreadful secret with them-and the dark dream that has begun to haunt you, wherein you betray those closest to you.

Bards who chronicle the past age sing of the Harpers, a secret society dedicated to advancing the cause of good across Faerûn. In the group's glory days, its members included figures of legend such as Storm Silverhand, whose beautiful voice matched her ferocity in battle, and Arilyn Moonblade, a half-elf wielder of powerful and ancient elven magic. The Harpers passed from existence in the wake of the Spellplague, but the organization was reborn sixty years ago and is now based out of the city of Everlund, several hundred miles northeast of Neverwinter. Its stated purpose is to stop the encroachment of the expanding empire of Netheril.
	You grew up hearing tales of the Harpers' exploits and have long sought to do your part to stem the tide of darkness. You've always had a facility for deception and intrigue, coupled with a strong sense of right and wrong. As you grew older, you searched for the best way to put those skills to good use. You journeyed to Everlund to enlist in the group, whereupon you were given a task to complete in order to earn your Harper pin.
	You were dispatched to Neverwinter, there to contact a local Harper agent named Cymril and lend your services to the Sons of Alagondar. Cymril, in addition to being one of the few Harpers in the city, is the leader of the Sons of Alagondar. This underground resistance movement opposes the imperialistic aims of Dagult Neverember, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, who has established himself as the “Protector” of Neverwinter during its reconstruction. The Harpers believe that Neverember's intentions are less than noble, and that he seeks to expand his mercantile empire for his own gain at the expense of the people. They are sure that, with his ruthless methods and suspect alliances, Neverember plans to usurp the throne of Neverwinter and build a cutthroat empire on the Sword Coast.
	On your arrival, you learned the hard way that Neverember's treachery runs deeper than even the Harpers know. You were included among a band of rebels on a nighttime reconnaissance mission led by Cymril. All of a sudden, your world turned inside out when a squad of Neverember's mercenaries ambushed your group. You avoided the initial assault by ducking into an alcove-where you watched as Cymril began cutting down your comrades! Clearly, she was working in league with the soldiers. One of Cymril's lieutenants turned on her and wounded her fatally just before he himself was cut down by the mercenaries.
	When the mercenaries moved on, they left the bodies of their victims (including Cymril) in the street as a warning to other dissidents. Before you left the area, you had the foresight to pluck Cymril's Harper pin from her vest, lest it fall into the wrong hands.
	Was Cymril truly a traitor to Neverwinter's cause, or was she working as a double agent? You can't be sure. What you do know is that when both the Sons of Alagondar and the Harpers got wind of what had happened, they immediately suspected that someone in the ambushed group was working for the other side.
	As the newcomer, you bear the brunt of the suspicion of both groups. The city's rebel forces have fractured since Cymril's death into disorganized and ineffective war bands. Discovering which of the few Harper associates in Neverwinter you can trust is important to you. However, if you have to work alone to get the job done, that's what you'll do. Your main goal is to ascertain the truth about Cymril, and in the process of doing that, you seek any means you can to thwart Neverember's true plans for the city.
	As a rogue agent, you work without official Harper support, and are free to use your own methods and make your own decisions regarding whom to trust. Each new day is an exciting and dangerous game of masks-guessing who speaks the truth, who offers you lies in the hope of securing an advantage, and who is the true enemy in any given situation. You follow a morality of your own-one that seeks the good in any situation, without compromise and without being afraid to take the fight to those who oppose you.

Thousands of years ago, in an age of great empires, the dwarven realm of Delzoun thrived. Said to be the pinnacle of dwarven culture, Delzoun was a place whose citizens were happy and productive, trading in relative peace with their neighbors. When Netheril was laid low by the folly of the mage Karsus, it was not only the Shadovar that suffered.
	Like so many of the dwarves of the North, your family claims direct descent from Delzoun. However, with so many making that same claim, who knows if any speak the truth? In private, for much of your life, you've had your doubts.
	Then seventeen years ago, during the Summons, the ghosts came.
	Perhaps only one in a thousand dwarves has made a believable claim to have seen them-but you are one of those chosen few. Clad in the vestments of ancient times, the ghosts spoke with a voice that only you could hear. Pleading in the manner of dwarves in the most desperate need, they begged for help-not for themselves, but for all your kind. They spoke of an “awakening beast” that must not be allowed to rise. And before they vanished, they begged you to come to them-in Gauntlgrym.
	Gauntlgrym. What dwarf of the North has not dreamed of that place? Most people think it a myth or a ruin cast to rubble ages ago, but dwarves know different. Dwarves feel the truth in their bones.
	For a time, Gauntlgrym was the capital of Delzoun. The underground city was the grandest settlement in the North-perhaps in all the world. Doors cast of pure mithral opened at a dwarf 's slightest touch. A forge burned there so mighty that items of enchantment could be made without magic. So great was Gauntlgrym that humans, elves, halflings, and gnomes all begged to live beneath its roof, and were welcome.
	Yet Gauntlgrym fell long ago-first to orcs, then to humans who claimed it, then to mind flayers, and finally to the mists of history. Rumors have placed it in numerous locations. Some claim to have seen it or have maps to it, but lunatics and scoundrels assert many things. The Summons drew many to search for it, including you.
	In the end, your search has brought you to the Neverwinter region, where Gauntlgrym might yet lie hidden. Some of your family think you mad. Others burn like the sun with pride, for you have the opportunity to prove their claim of Delzoun blood. Many have sought Gauntlgrym before; others do so now, because you are not the only dwarf to have seen the phantoms or to claim the blood of ages. But if you can succeed, you can elevate yourself and your family name to the heights of dwarven annals and legends. You can restore the remnants of your people's greatest glory. And, just possibly, you can prevent the rise of an evil as great as that which destroyed Delzoun.
	The dire warnings of the ghosts whose summons you obey weigh heavily on your heart. You have followed the rumors that bore the greatest ring of truth, but now that you've reached Neverwinter, you know that completing your quest will require all the help you can get.

Anyone with a passing knowledge of history knows of Iliyanbruen-the great kingdom of the mortal world that was home and sanctuary to the elves after the dissolution of the empire of Illefarn. Like the empire that spawned it, Iliyanbruen also fell in time. Many of its folk left for Evermeet, even as others retreated into the Feywild. With powerful magic, the elves of old transported most of Sharandar, the capital city of Iliyanbruen, to the Feywild. Their plan was for Iliyanbruen to rise once more on the site of the original home of the elven people-but events seldom align with the intentions of those who live them.
	Although Iliyanbruen rose once more, the Feywild was no empty frontier. The forces that drove the ancient elves to first leave Faerie for the world still held sway in many places. Enemies of these returned folk-particularly the Winter Court and the Twilight Fey-arrayed against them. Treants, dryads, centaurs, firbolgs, satyrs, and other creatures that might once have been allies saw the Iliyanbruen eladrin only as invaders.
	Generations of battles and legends later, Iliyanbruen endures as a realm, its borders several days' walk from the ruins of Sharandar. That land has always been your home, and your people have lived there in relative peace for generations.
	With the coming of the Spellplague, everything changed. Faerie and the world were brought into conjunction once more. Some eladrin grew eager to determine what had become of their worldly home. This was easier said than done, however, for a covey of hags and their dark servants had taken over Sharandar, making travel difficult at best. Although you initially had little real interest in old Iliyanbruen beyond mild historical curiosity, you were quick to join the effort at ousting the evil fey from the region.
	Several of your friends were injured or slain before your people reclaimed the territory and established an outpost in the ruins. From there, you and your fellows ventured back into the mortal world where the eladrin of Iliyanbruen had not stepped for centuries.
	You were horrified at what you found. Though you had expected the kingdom's ancient tree-cities to have fallen into disrepair, you found many of them looted as well. Their structures were ravaged and desecrated, with ancient treasures of statuary, artwork, and holy icons all stolen away.
	Fierce debate arose among the fey of New Sharandar. Some, enraged by what had occurred, demanded that the eladrin reenter the mortal world in force, wreaking vengeance on any who lingered near the ruins of Iliyanbruen-or even the entirety of what was once Illefarn. Others of calmer mien said that the eladrin should reclaim the greatest ruins of Iliyanbruen, restore them to the glory of old, and take vengeance only on those directly responsible for their debasement. However, for that effort to work, the eladrin must learn who has despoiled their ancient home.
	You are determined to find out who has ravaged the ruins, which are already weakened by time. In discovering who stole your ancestral treasures-and what creatures deserve your wrath-you intend that justice be meted out appropriately. You are driven not only by anger and vengeance, but also by a sense of urgency. For you know that if you fail, the wrathful among your people will gain the upper hand, spilling the blood of the guilty and the innocent alike.
	Many eladrin have made the natural world their home as they seek answers-and you are one of them. Some set out in search of allies, hoping that fabled Evermeet or one of the elven kingdoms of old still exists. Others have set their sights on the areas closer to Neverwinter Wood, feeling certain that those responsible for the desecration of your birthright have not gone far.
	It appears that you were right. Even as you began your investigation of the ruins of Neverwinter, you arrived late for a rendezvous with your fellows to find them slain by powerful magic. Whoever the wrongdoers might be, they outnumber you. You know you need allies in the fight against them, but if news of the slaughter spreads among your people in the Feywild, it could mean war. Even worse, Iliyanbruen might decide to sever ties with the past once and for all.

Twenty-seven years ago, before you were even born, the city of Neverwinter perished in a great conflagration that slew its people and scattered survivors across the north. Since then, the angry earth has calmed, inviting people to return to the ruins of this once-great settlement. Dagult Neverember-the imperialist Open Lord of Waterdeep-has declared himself a distant relation of the old rulers of Neverwinter, and thus claims to be the rightful heir to their holdings. He has installed himself as Neverwinter's Lord Protector until the city is rebuilt and order is fully restored-at which point he is expected to name himself king. Given Neverember's control of Waterdeepand the military and magical power that control grants him, few have expressed any desire to dispute his claim-at least not until a true heir is found.
	A true heir such as you.
	You are a last scion of Neverwinter's former ruling family. Your mother was a noble who fled the city during the cataclysm, wounded during her escape and driven to madness by pain and grief. When she perished shortly after you were born, a noble family of Waterdeep-the Thanns-took you in and raised you as their own.
	You grew up with heroic stories, poetry, and the best education a young noble could have. With Neverwinter in ruins and your kin all dead, your adoptive parents thought it best to hide from you their knowledge of your tragic past. However, in the aftermath of Lord Neverember's seizing power in Neverwinter, you have finally been told the truth.
	At first, you weren't certain what to do. In one moment, it felt as though you had lost two families-the old and the new. You had never seen Neverwinter, but what you had heard of the city didn't make it seem like a place worth claiming. If you ignored your birthright, you could continue to live a life of relative ease and luxury in Waterdeep.
	Eventually, you came to see your problem a different way. Though your new family will always be there for you, whatever remains of your connection to Neverwinter is in imminent danger of being swept away. You have the opportunity to know your lost past-even if only through the relics of that past. And by claiming what belongs to you, you'll exchange a life of idle nobility for one of responsible royalty.
	Yet you are not naive enough to believe that the path forward will be easy. Reclaiming the city is not as simple as declaring your identity. Neverember commands an army of warriors and mages, and his influence ties him to hundreds of powerful individuals around the Sword Coast with their own reasons to crush an upstart like a flea.
	You need proof of your ancestry-something in the ruins of the city that can verify the story that was told to you. If you're lucky, you might find a symbol of your royal past such as a crown or a scepter to lend credence to your claim. Then you will have to prove yourself a champion-to win the hearts and minds of the people as you convince them that it is you, not Neverember, who deserves to rule a reclaimed and rebuilt Neverwinter. Only then might you restore the city to its past glory and do honor to your blood heritage.
	You recognize the need to gather allies, both to defend the city against its many foes and to protect yourself against those who want to prevent you from reclaiming your birthright. Whether your fellows know your true heritage or not is up to you.

The dreams began for you as for so many others. Strange shapes half seen in the darkness. Eerie sounds that upon waking made you think of the sea. A sense of otherness, and of unseen watchers. Such disturbing nightmares afflict the minds of sensitive people throughout the North, yet in your sleep, a light parts the shadows.
	When the nightmares come, a blue-green flame erupts to burn away the threats. When your eyes adjust, you find yourself in a grand library. As you walk a glittering hall between high bookshelves, the passage extends outward before you like a long road. You wake before you reach the end, no matter how fast you run. But as you open your eyes, a sound echoes in your ears-the flow and gears of a water clock.
	To you, the meaning could not be clearer. Oghma, god of knowledge and thought, is bidding you to go to Neverwinter and restore his temple, the House of Knowledge. An ancient homily revealed by your dream lies at the heart of your understanding. To swear “by the clocks of Neverwinter” was once a most solemn promise, so sure and perfect were the water clocks made by the artisans of that city.
	Once, Neverwinter drew experts in art and craft from around the world, standing as a shining example of beauty and art. Now, the city lies in ruins. The temple to Oghma, broken by the destruction that claimed Neverwinter, could become the center of the city's renaissance. The techniques of lost craft guilds, the work of the region's finest artisans, secrets of architecture and engineering, as well as songs, scrolls, and items of enchantment-all might be recovered from the temple's extensive archives. Ancient relics and lore now lost elsewhere in the ruins could be collected in the library for the use of all. The House of Knowledge could become the House of Hope.
	You set out to Neverwinter to be a part of the city's restoration. You know you can't accomplish this task on your own, but Oghma will help you develop friendships with those who can assist you, and will aid you in crafting the alliances necessary to bring Neverwinter to life again. Because of your labors and guidance, the city will become a light in the darkness that threatens to swallow the North.

Not all members of the Gray Wolf tribe manifest the beast within in the same way, but you all share it to one extent or another, feeling it bind you in ways few other people can comprehend. You are warriors among your humanoid kin, predators among the beasts of the woodland. You move as one, you live as one, you hunt as one.
	Or rather, you did.
	For uncounted generations, your people have venerated the five spiritual pillars on which Gray Wolf culture is based-tradition, the primal spirits, your god Uthgar, the spirits of your ancestors, and the natural order. It never crossed your mind what might happen if the tribe violated any of those precepts, because such a thing was unthinkable. But in the end, the unthinkable happened.
	In retrospect, you could see the first hints long before things went truly wrong. The current Gray Wolf leaders are more vicious, more bloodthirsty, than those who came before. The Gray Wolf Uthgardt has always been a violent tribe-you carry the fury of the werewolf, after all. However, where you once killed only for sustenance or in defense of your tribal territories, your folk have become raiders as much as hunters.
	Gray Wolf hunters began to kill for material gain-even, on dark occasion, for sport. Then that darkness was deepened when the shadowed ones came, claiming to represent ancient Netheril reborn. Through honeyed words and the invocation of ancient and long-forgotten alliances, they enticed your leaders into an insidious pact.
	The history of your tribe has been passed down through generations as stories told by the fireside, and the tales the Netherese told matched those stories. The Uthgardt did come from the blood of old Netheril. The lycanthropy that makes the Gray Wolf tribe strong originated in descendants of Netheril, when refugees from fallen Gauntlgrym carried the curse into the tribe.
	Yet these facts alone would not have been enough to form an alliance had not the pack's leaders hungered for the glory of which the shadowed ones spoke. They said that just as old blood ties could be remembered, so too could the glory of the Uthgardt be revived. Conquest would achieve that glory, and when the Netherese controlled the North, the Gray Wolf tribe would be the masters of everything else.
	Now, your kin fight, kill, and die in the name of motives and goals not their own. However, though doing so went against everything you'd ever been taught, you are among the few who have refused to take up the darkness of this new path. Your instincts told you it was right to do so, even as the Gray Wolf leaders cast you out. Your tribe called you weak and unworthy, yet you left with your head held high.
	Indeed, from what you have heard, it's a good thing you made your stand when you did. Had you waited, your punishment might have been more final than exile. Whispered messages, passed to you by those who feel as you do, suggest that the tribe's leaders are now willing to slaughter their own-not in proper challenge, but in cold-blooded murder.
	You have a new purpose now. You must drive the shadows of Netheril from the North, finding a way to purge your tribe of the unsavory influences of that land. Only when you set the tribe on the right path will you win back your place in it.
	You remain a creature of the pack, however, and you know you cannot realize your purpose alone. You must find new allies-a temporary pack to replace the one you have lost.

Thay is a nation dedicated to magic and death-a land where undead are not only common, they hold great power. The regent Szass Tam and his Council of Zulkirs-liches all-rule this warring, slaving nation with fists of bone and iron. Those who have grown up under this regime find life in Thay entirely normal-fearsome, perhaps, but not at all unnatural. Those who have the proper magical skills and mindset can even carve out their own place within the necromantic order.
	You were such a wizard-destined for greatness because of your magical potential. To your family's great honor, you joined the prestigious academies used to train mages for the ever-growing ranks of the Red Wizards of Thay. There, you were taught the fundamentals of magic in all its schools and forms, but your focus was necromancy.
	At the time, this dedication seemed normal to you. Manipulating the forces of death itself? Animating those who had been living, breathing, laughing people into mindless, shambling slaves? This is the order of things in Thay-and will be the order across the rest of Faerûn if the regent has his way.
	So might your life have gone, had not your best friend-a partner and companion throughout your years of schooling-failed an assigned experiment. It was nothing disastrous, only a ritual that went ever so slightly awry, but the event sent your instructor into a rage. When that rage was spent, your friend was dead, his life force sundered by necrotic energy.
	He was also your next project, for his was the body that the class-working together to perform magic none of you could handle alone-was ordered to reanimate. And you complied, for fear of what might happen if you did not.
	For the first time, the grotesque, decaying face before you was not that of a stranger. For the first time, you knew of and could feel the utter absence of the life and laughter that once had thrived behind those eyes.
	You finally understood the horror of what you had been trained to do, and in that moment you forswore necromancy-and Thay itself.
	It wasn't that hard to flee, for who would ever try to escape the academies-one of the only ways to gain real power in Szass Tam's Thay? By the time they knew to look for you, you were already gone.
	You can barely remember the exhausting, starving months of travel, constantly watching over your shoulder. When you came to the Sword Coast, you realized you had literally fled as far as you could go. Only then did it occur to you to stop running and try to determine what the future might hold.
	In time, you wandered north to Neverwinter, a place where most of the population was struggling to build new lives. A place where you thought you might fit in. However, it didn't take you long to hear whispered rumors of a darkness in the North-rumors that dashed all hope of leaving your past behind.
	The Thayans are here, conducting their foul experiments and stealing people away in the night. How many Neverwintans have joined the ranks of Thay's slaves after death? How often are more living, laughing faces taking on the foul grin of the undead?
	It never crossed your mind to run again. You don't know what the Thayans are doing in the North, but you know that their efforts here can be stopped. They can be defeated. You can protect your new home from what you once were.

More than a century has passed since the Year of Wild Magic and the return of Thultanthar, the City of Shade, to the skies of Faerûn. This last bastion of ancient Netheril had survived for over a millennium in the depths of the Shadowfell, where the raw essence of shadow has long intertwined with the souls of the Shadovar. Some have become shades; some are born shadar-kai. Most are still human, but with an element of darkness about them.
	You were born into the nobility of the Shadovar-not at any great rank, but high enough to ensure yourself a position of power in the restored empire. Like all Shadovar, you were raised to believe in Netherese supremacy-bombarded constantly with the knowledge that dominance was your people's birthright, that the other peoples of Toril were weak and inferior, and that Netheril would rule once more.
	You had no reason not to believe in your great destiny. At least, not at first. However, as your education progressed, you were sent out into the world to observe Netherese military actions. Serving the overseers of “reclaimed” communities, you would occasionally skirmish with the border patrols of neighboring nations. For reasons you still do not fully understand, something in the world beyond Shade Enclave spoke to you as your home never had.
	You stood in the light of the sun, untouched by the lingering darkness of the Shadowfell, and felt its burn not as painful but as cleansing. You observed the “weak and worthless” folk beyond Netheril and perceived a simple joy for life that you could never imagine seeing within the Shadovar. You knew instantly that this was the life you wanted-one far from the machinations, tyranny, and darkness of your home.
	You had to pull some strings and con your family into pulling others. However, in the end, it wasn't hard to have yourself assigned to the ongoing Netherese efforts in Neverwinter Wood, hunting for old ruins and ancient magic. Your hope was that this Shadovar endeavor farthest from Netheril would provide you the opportunity to disappear before you were missed.
	It worked, in part. You were able to slip away between expeditions into the woods and make your way to Neverwinter. So far, you've managed to keep your past a secret, seeming to be just one of the many people trying to make a fresh start in a slowly recovering city.
	Yet something eats at you as you try to start your new life. Your people have not come to the North just to dig up the detritus of old empires. The magic they find here is meant to be put to a purpose. You don't know what that purpose might be, but before you left Netheril, you heard whispered rumors that spoke of raising an enclave.
	It's a crazy idea. The magic to perform such a mighty ritual hasn't existed since the fall of Netheril over a thousand years ago. Certainly, other enclaves have been launched into the air since the Year of Wild Magic, but these were existing structures. The powerful magic of the mythallars that allows such structures to take to the skies was already extant, only needing repair. Surely nothing like that could be found anywhere near Neverwinter . . . or could it?
	You came to Neverwinter to flee, but more and more, you wonder if you could ever have run far enough. If you remain here, you know you won't be able to hide forever. If the Netherese succeed in their plans for the region, a new Shadovar stronghold might arise here-one possibly as mighty as Shade Enclave. If that happens, you would find yourself in the shadow of Netheril once again. Much as you'd like to simply vanish into the darkness, the dark is where your people are most dangerous. And that means your only option is to face them here.

Nearly a century ago, Faerûn was ravaged by the Spellplague. Few of those alive today can describe this scourge firsthand, and every story disagrees in the details. Landscapes changed, whole cities vanished, and alien nations installed themselves where barren wasteland and the ruins of past civilizations had stood for millennia. Magic failed or went wild, and thousands upon thousands died horribly. Those who encountered the plague directly, either initially or in the long years since, have been forever changed by its touch. Most are horribly deformed or otherwise cursed-even as a rare few gain a strange kind of power.
	Someone seeing you as a youth might not have known you were bound to such a twisted destiny. You were a normal person, living out a normal life. You had family and friends, and you were looking forward to marriage and children to carry on your legacy. These simple pleasures were not to be yours, however-not once the nightmares began. You ignored the visions at first, but you could not do so for long.
	One night, you awoke from a nightmare screaming, engulfed in blue flames that were no dream. Though it did not harm you, this unnatural fire wreaked havoc on everything nearby, consuming your home and those you loved, their screams echoing as they burned. When the flames died away, they left in their wake disfigurements on the bodies of the dead-warped limbs, blue scar tissue, or strange runes in a language you did not recognize. Though you survived the destruction, your body was likewise scarred.
	Hated for the harm you inflicted unintentionally and despised for your deformity, you fled your home in fear. Dependent on the aid of strangers to survive, you were saved when a wandering priest sworn to Ilmater, god of compassion, directed you to Helm's Hold outside the city of Neverwinter. There, he promised, people like you were welcome. “The spellscarred,” he called you.
	During your journey, you have tried to puzzle out the reason for the emergence of your curse, to no certain success. Perhaps you were exposed to the Spellplague long ago, and it then lay dormant in you for years. Some say the curse can be inherited by blood, and so the affliction will lead inevitably to more death-for you and those around you.
	You fear that your time grows short. Whenever you rest, the nightmares that haunted you before your scarring return, coupled with visions of magical cataclysms wreathed in blue flame. You have grown accustomed to looking over your shoulder at all times, struggling to trust even those who seek to aid you.
	A time is coming when you'll be able to conceal your true nature no longer. When that day comes, how will you embrace your uncertain destiny? And can the people in Helm's Hold truly help you?

You are an Uthgardt barbarian-a member of one of the savage human tribes that took Uthgar's name and worshiped him after he fell defending his people from the Pale Giants in ancient days. The deity Tempus took Uthgar into his service then, and now Uthgar fights beside the Lord of Battle in the realms beyond the mortal world. You are part of the Thunderbeast tribe, and even as you pay homage to Uthgar and the spirits of your ancestors, you keep the sacred secret of those great reptilian creatures where they hide in the shadowed heart of the High Forest.
	Recently, your tribe left its High Forest home to travel far west to Neverwinter Wood. As is tradition for all Uthgardt, autumn is the time of Runemeet-a holy period when each tribe travels to its ancestor mound to worship the ancient spirits. Your tribe's mound is Morgur's Mound, considered to be the holiest site of your people. There, Uthgar shed his blood in battle against Gurt, Lord of the Pale Giants, and broke the back of Gurt's armies to save the North from domination. Within that same mound are buried the remains of Uthgar's mortal brother, the hero Morgur.
	At Runemeet, youths in an Uthgardt tribe who want to become fully recognized members must engage in a ritual hunt of sworn enemies of their tribe-wolves, in the case of the Thunderbeast barbarians. This was to be your hunt year, and you looked forward to the ceremonies and celebrations at the most holy of the ancestor mounds with great anticipation. However, the ceremony was not to be.
	Your tribe found Morgur's Mound desecrated. The skeleton of the thunderbeast that had rested atop it for untold generations had been stolen, and the mound broken open like a gutted animal. The holy bones of Uthgar's brother and the treasures they had been buried with were taken as well.
	The immensity of the tragedy and the affront to your tribe-indeed, to all Uthgardt-drove your people mad for a time. Once rage cooled to grief, your chieftain Grandthur announced that the tribe would return to the High Forest. Whoever had defiled your ancestor mound had covered their tracks well, and it would take time to discover the culprits. To spend this time so close to the open wound in their hearts would weaken your people, for without an ancestor mound, they could not perform the traditions that would keep them strong.
	Grandthur declared that the tribe would travel to Flint Rock, the ancestor mound of the Elk Tribe, to join their fellow Uthgardt there. Then the chieftain turned to you.
	Although you were not yet ceremonially recognized, you had proven yourself an able hunter and a combatant who could rival the veterans of the tribe in skill and tenacity. To replace the ritual hunt that you had been meant to undertake, Grandthur gave you the task of discovering the defilers. It would be your duty to await the return of the Gray Wolf tribe-the Uthgardt who traditionally roam near Neverwinter Wood but who were currently away to the north at their own ancestor mound, Raven Rock. You will ask them what they know of the ruin brought upon your people and request their help in restoring Morgur's Mound to its sacred purpose. Grandthur also made it clear that if you discover the Gray Wolves had some hand in the desecration, the quarry of your special ritual hunt will be a wolf of a different kind.

You grew up on the mean streets of ruined Neverwinter, long after the Spellplague reduced the city to smoldering rubble. You learned the laws of this new world the hard way, and watched first-hand as the struggle to survive shattered families, stole livelihoods, and destroyed lives. As long as you can remember, you have suffered from the bizarre nightmares that are part of life in the broken city.
	As bad as it gets, nothing has chased you away from your home. You are a child of Neverwinter, and while the city still stands, you refuse to kneel.
	A few years ago, when Dagult Neverember, a lord of Waterdeep, arrived to stabilize and rebuild the city, you saw right through him. To you, he is not a savior but an invader-his army of “peacekeepers” an occupation force. You might have regarded them benignly at first, hoping your doubts would prove unfounded, but Neverember's goons quickly dashed any illusions you had about their intentions. But most people in the city aren't privy to your insight, or aren't willing to listen. You found that all the rhetoric in the world won't convince the people to rise up and resist the great “Protector,” so you turned to more direct means.
	You joined the rebel movement known as the Sons of Alagondar, named for the city's legendary royal family. With the Sons, you found ways to channel your rage, and felt as though in some small ways you have successfully restrained the usurper of your homeland.
	The rebels have suffered setbacks recently, however. Their charismatic leader, Cymril, was slain less than a month ago, plunging the organization into chaos. Factions have emerged, each of them forging alliances with dark forces in the city. Some operatives of the Sons have made overtures to the brutish Dead Rats gang, while others curry favor with the malevolent Red Wizards in the city. Caught between your principles and the necessity of having potent allies, you aren't sure who you can trust. What started as a noble and simple fight for freedom has become complicated.
	You have choices to make, and none of them are good. You dream of yet another solution: the return of a true heir of House Alagondar, who can unite the city against the usurper. But even if a true heir were to appear, would you welcome him with relief or suspicion?

You grew to adulthood in the shade of Ardeep Forest among a small community of elves, not far from the bustling metropolis of Waterdeep. You were raised on legends, tales, and songs of the kingdom of Ardeep and the great elven empire of Illefarn before it.
	In ancient days, elves ruled a great empire in the North called Illefarn. This empire fractured when the last Coronal of the elves led the retreat to Evermeet. Illefarn split into the nations of Ardeep, Iliyanbruen, and Rilitha. These kingdoms each fell in turn over the centuries, with the last of the elves leaving Ardeep for Evermeet over a century ago.
	Your parents and others moved into the Ardeep Forest to try to reclaim and relive something of Ardeep's former glory. But little remains of  that lost civilization. As the seasons passed into years, you dreamed of glorious days when your people ruled the region in peace and fairness. You imagined ancient Aelinthaldaar, the capital of Illefarn, rising tall where Waterdeep stands now. You mourned the loss of that nation as though it happened recently, not gone from the world for over two thousand years. Illefarn fell not to the hostile orcs and other enemies that sought to destroy it, but to humans and dwarves and allied races whose growing presence squeezed the elves until the Coronal felt there was no room left for the culture that had thrived in the region since before the Crown Wars.
	In your youth, you returned time and again to a glade dedicated to Corellon-not to pray, but to gaze in awe upon relics of lost Illefarn, including a single, cracked arrow said to have been launched from the bow of the empire's last Coronal, Syglaeth Audark.
	But these were mere daydreams and empty wishes, and not part of your daily life until a few months ago, when several of your town's hunters returned with the body of an eladrin found dead near the Crypts of the Deepening Moon. Your people know well enough to avoid those tombs of Ardeep because of the creatures that guard them. Yet the fallen eladrin did not appear to be a typical tomb robber: the quality of her clothes and possessions indicated someone of higher rank, akin to a diplomat. But the style of her possessions more resembled the old fashions you'd seen on the statues and carvings of the ruins of Illefarn.
	The town assembled a party of hunters and warriors to follow the eladrin's trail and learn where she came from, and you, having recently proven your skills in such matters, went along. Tracking the eladrin was hard but not impossible, with the trail eventually leading to Waterdeep. However, finding anyone who remembered the eladrin in such an enormous place proved more difficult than tracking her week-old trail through the forest, and many of your fellows abandoned the quest. But you pushed on. Something about the mystery drove you.
	You finally met a group of moon elves that had seen the eladrin. They said she was secretive and spoke with a strange accent. She said she sought Ardeep, and the elves had assumed she meant Ardeep Forest. Apparently she had come from Neverwinter by ship. Why had she traveled to Ardeep Forest all the way from Neverwinter? Why the strange accent and clothes? Where did she come from-out of the distant past? It could be that the Neverwinter Woods, once the bastion of Iliyanbruen and a part of ancient Illefarn, holds the answers.
	Perhaps it was fate, or an omen from the gods, that this should happen now, when you are old enough to choose your own way and skilled enough to make a difference. In the mysterious depths of the Neverwinter Woods and its surroundings, you can seek out other lost remnants of ancient Illefarn. You must locate them, and reclaim their wonders, their knowledge, and their treasures for the elves, to whom they rightfully belong. You must safeguard your heritage from those who would desecrate it for personal gain. And if you can, you must uncover the truth about the mysterious eladrin.

Everyone wants good luck, but few have minds broad enough to embrace the whole of fate, sense what is meant to be, and follow that path. Those who do so learn to accept both the best and the worst that the world can offer. Fatedancers understand that what should not happen, cannot happen; the proper way to live is to embrace what must be. By accepting what fate offers, they gain more than peace of mind-everything they do aligns with the true purpose of the world.
	To know fate is to dance, for life compels one to quickly move from here to there, from one thought or place or event to another. Though outsiders believe fatedancers to be mercurial at best, random chance does not exist for those who embrace fate, only opportunities taken or missed. The future and the present are always exactly as they should be for fatedancers; such individuals exist in the moment. They get into a lot of trouble because of this stance, but they are usually lucky enough to get out of it. Theirs is the life of a vagabond, taking both good and bad fortune as it comes.
	Any adventurer who believes in luck as a force can be a fatedancer. Martial characters most often choose this theme. They do not depend on any external source for their powers, so they are attracted to a path that depends on their own actions. To their minds, reliance on arcane magic or the power of the gods is an attempt to circumvent what should happen.
	Bards and rogues also have worldviews that encourage this way of life. Bards weave songs that tell of heroes' fortunes and misfortunes and thus naturally respect the power of fate. A few follow this tendency further and learn to rely on it, even though they also use arcane magic. Rogues approach their lives with equal parts daring, skill, and luck, but many take to heart the idea that it is better to be lucky than skilled.
Creating: A fatedancer's relationship with Fortune Cards is different from that of other characters.  By choosing this theme, your character has a greater choice of cards to play, as well as abilities that augment and encourage their use.  Other characters' Fortune Card decks vary thematically, but a fatedancer can build a deck with a wide variety of cards.  Their effects are thus more situational, but your increased hand size and card-drawing abilities let you be better prepared for any situation.
    Fatedancers favor no alignment, since a rigid attitude toward life obstructs their adventures and travels.  Rare are good-aligned fatedancers, but rarer still are those who are evil.  Such agents of chaos follow fortune along its dark edges, to the peril of all nearby.

In Kara-Tur, as in the West, grand shrines can be found in the teeming cities. However, those seeking a quicker path to enlightenment or total devotion to the gods prefer remote monasteries or temples. Such places of worship offer immersion in spiritual pursuits and isolation from the distractions of civilization. Most are hidden high in remote hills or mountains, making the very act of finding the place a show of one's dedication to the sacred.
	An urban shrine's clergy can look to the local authorities for protection from monsters, bandits, and enemies of the faith. A wilderness temple's devotees cannot-most secluded places of worship are as much fortress as monastery. Just as such a holy place needs walls, it also needs guardians who share the spiritual values of their less militant fellows.
	A sohei, sometimes called a yamabushi (“mountain warrior”) due to the usual site of farflung monasteries and shrines, is a monastic soldier trained as a temple guardian. Rather than focusing on intense religious instruction, a sohei receives training in meditation, body control, and martial techniques. Although devoted clergy of the same religion or sect might practice pacifism, a sohei warrior-monk does not.
	The difference between a sohei and a fellow priest is type of duty. The warrior-monk looks out for the safety of the temple, allowing other priests to fulfill duties that are more spiritual. A sohei can also serve as the face of a religious order, going out into the world to spread the faith, strike against the temple's enemies, and seek objects and people important to the religion.
	A sohei's superiors are figures higher in his or her religious hierarchy. Every sohei is a devoted combatant with mastery over preferred weapons, and each serves those higher in the hierarchy with obedience. As part of their service to the religion, they also learn to wield magical power. Often divine in nature, this power is a blessing of the sohei's commitment to a deity. However, legendary sohei-even those from the same religious sect-wield varying mystical capabilities.
	A sohei can come from any walk of life. Children given into the service of a temple, whether orphans or nobles, can become sohei. Older initiates might be anything from outlaws to ronin. Requirements for becoming a militant priest include strength and willpower, as well as an abundance of energy and ambition that compels the individual to abandon the wholly meditative life.
	An adventuring sohei frequently takes on a quest for his or her religious order. A few sohei go into the world to experience its mysteries, using worldly knowledge as part of a path to enlightenment. Other sohei, such as ronin, have been expelled from or have lost their temples. These wanderers search for a new purpose as much as any ronin does.
Creating: Sohei are religious devotees focused on martial practice. Although they might have different religions, purposes, and techniques, divine power unites them. Most of these warrior-monks come from among weapon-using divine classes, such as the avenger, cleric, paladin, and runepriest. Some sohei focus more on the martial aspect of training than on the supernatural, as fighters, rangers, and warlords do. Obscure religious orders that are devoted to primal or ancestral spirits could train barbarians, druids, seekers, and wardens to become sohei. Other cults might focus on the power of the mind over the body. Psionic practitioners such as ardents, battleminds, and monks could be sohei among these sects. Religious devotion can also involve arcane practice or shadow magic-a pious assassin, blackguard, hexblade, or swordmage might become a sohei.

Between Faerûn and Kara-Tur is a vast steppe, held through history by more than one ancient empire. Despite the area's turbulent past, the advent of the Spellplague, and the rise of the Tuigan nation of Yaïmunnahar, the folk of the Hordelands live as they have for centuries. Because the steppe offers few resources, all the nomads of the Hordelands-Taan, as they call themselves-are master riders and hardy survivalists. They rely on their mounts and livestock, as well as connections to nature and primal power, for survival.
	People of the Hordelands venerate Teylas, the Sky Lord, who is called Akadi in Faerûn, and worship Etugen, Earth Mother, known among Faerûnians as Grumbar. Additionally, and to a lesser degree, the nomads idolize a plethora of other primal spirits. Some of these latter entities live in named places, such as oases, across the plains. Others represent important or fierce animals of the prairie.
	Tribal customs among the nomads focus on pleasing the spirits as they seek to ensure that the elements remain in balance. Those living in the Hordelands believe that bad luck, such as an inability to find water, is the work of offended spirits. To aid them in their work with the spirits, the nomads use primal magic, and their familiarity with it grants them a sixth sense when it comes to spiritual influences. Not only do they gain closeness to the spirits that surround them, they can sense the presence of myriad fey crossings on the plains, which provides them with the opportunity to interact with fey creatures, too.
Creating: Nomads of the Hordelands are predominantly human, although a few have nonhuman blood. Every adult nomad is a warrior, though with varying skills, and all nomads respect primal spirits rather than deities. Martial practitioners and primal spellcasters are most widespread; only a few tribesfolk practice arcane arts. Fighters, rangers, and warlords are common, as are barbarians, druids, seekers, shamans, and wardens. Warlocks, especially those of the fey or vestige pact, and sorcerers are the usual wielders of arcane power among the nomads. These people consider a “shaman” to be anyone who has powers unrelated to weapon use, even if those powers are not primal.

Samurai are the elite warriors of the nations of Kozakura and Wa, trained since childhood in the arts of battle. Sworn in service to the powerful nobles who govern the empire, they are expected to live and die according to their master's command. Cultured and refined, samurai dedicate themselves utterly to the tenets of bushido-the warrior's code that teaches that one's life is not one's own, and that nothing is more important than honor, obedience, and courage.
	Samurai are born into their class, enjoying social privileges second only to the ruling nobility. Many come from families that own land themselves, and thus grow up accustomed to a life of wealth and entitlement. The samurai's lofty place in society sometimes leads individuals down a path of arrogance or brutality, since a samurai is above the law when dealing with those of lower station; however, true followers of bushido emphasize traits such as benevolence and politeness, as well as courage.
	A samurai's training begins at a young age, when he is introduced to the rigorous demands of bushido. Young samurai are exposed to extreme heat, cold, and pain, enduring all with emotionless poise. They are steeled against the fear of death by being sent on errands through graveyards or near hangman's gallows at night. Each samurai-in-training is taught to read and write, contemplating classics of literature, religion, and art with which to refine his mind and spirit. Finally, all are taught the martial arts for which these warriors are most well known.
	Samurai heroes are expected to fight and die at their lord's command, and their adventures reflect that. Samurai will undertake any quest their master assigns them, whether waging open war or avenging an insult to their lord's honor; a samurai obeys without hesitation. A samurai who proves worthy of reward will be honored with lands and wealth, and, perhaps most important, the lord's approval. This honor, and the perpetual striving toward one's perfection of bushido, is all-important for a samurai, who will go to any length to maintain and uphold it. Should a samurai bring shame to himself or his master, he is allowed to take his own life in an act of ritualistic suicide, allowing him to die with his honor intact. For a samurai, death is preferable to dishonor.
Creating: Samurai are overwhelmingly drawn to classes that emphasize weapon prowess. The fighter class has the physical fortitude and skill at arms that are the hallmarks of the samurai; however, cultural and environmental aspects of the setting are sometimes best addressed by the talents of other classes. For instance, in realms that wage perpetual war, samurai often become warlords, while those realms on the frontier find the resourcefulness of the ranger to be an important trait for samurai. Exceptionally cultured or mystical lands welcome samurai of arcane or divine classes as well, so long as the individual is able to wield a sword bravely when the time comes. No matter your class or race, as a samurai you are held to the strictest of behavioral standards.

Outcasts, renegades, folk heroes, and criminals-the yakuza are many things to different people, but without exception they are the rejects of a society that values conformity. There is a saying in Kozakura: “The nail that sticks up must be hammered down.” The yakuza proudly view themselves as these nails, but refuse to be treated as such.
	Although the true nature of the yakuza is hard to identify, most will agree that collectively they are scoundrels who live by their own rules and code of honor. Banding together in clannish groups, yakuza gain security and power by exploiting society through robbery or extortion. Most are viewed as criminals, but not necessarily with distaste; the unusual behavior of the yakuza makes them both loved and despised in the cities in which they operate.
	Yakuza often work as street peddlers, smugglers, thugs, gamblers, or racketeers. They associate with each other through bonds of loyalty to their clan, which might include hundreds of members. Yakuza clans are highly organized using a hierarchical structure with the boss taking on the role of father and his subordinates the obedient children. Loyalty and honor are paramount to yakuza, though they eschew the ethics of bushido in favor of more pragmatic concerns.
	In the view of most merchants and the officials of cities, yakuza are law-breaking thugs and criminals. The yakuza cultivate their image as iconoclasts, and purposefully commit robberies and vandalism to ruffle the feathers of authority. A yakuza clan often becomes the recognized face of crime within a city, wallowing in a self-made underworld; however, yakuza also realize that their livelihood depends on existing in the shadows of civilization, and they are not unnecessarily destructive of people or property in their criminal enterprises.
	Some yakuza go so far as to actively attend to the needs of their communities, using resources to help those that the ruling classes have ignored. Many peasants view the yakuza as heroes standing up for the underdog against a society that treads on them. A yakuza clan might defend peasants from bandits or the brutality of an arrogant samurai. Some clans donate wealth to improving the infrastructure of their city. Yakuza have even acted as spies or assassins during times of war to protect their cities from the ravages of loot-hungry attackers. In some cases, these actions are viewed with a standoffish respect by authorities, who allow the yakuza to operate with impunity as long as their criminal activities don't get out of hand.
Creating: As outcasts in the society of Kozakura, most yakuza find themselves becoming rogues or assassins in order to survive in the underbelly of civilization. These characters quickly develop the skills and the mind-set that allow them to thrive in this cutthroat environment. Fighters also find a welcome place among yakuza, adopting roles as bodyguards or enforcers who do their bosses' dirty work. Yakuza clans are very inclusive, inclined to welcome anyone cast off from society who can be useful to their organization. As a result, unlikely characters such as clerics, druids, and wizards sometimes find a place within a yakuza clan's ranks. These characters often become vital assets to a clan, their talents giving it an edge over rivals.

When the natural world was young and humanity was in its infancy, callous elf nobles intentionally opened fey crossings between their realm and the natural world, sending dangerous monsters through to terrorize early mortal civilizations. Many of humanity's oldest folk tales concern these first encounters with creatures such as owlbears and displacer beasts. Although eladrin scholars have tried to disprove the assertion that their ancestors were responsible, there is no doubt that an unusual number of stories passed down by human cultures involve such occurrences.
	However troublesome or malicious the ancient elves might have been, they inadvertently gave the people of the natural world a familiarity with fey creatures. During these formative years for human culture, contact with Feywild beasts had a great impact; the magic of that plane touched hearts and souls in the mortal world. As a result, some members of mortal races developed an affinity for dealing with creatures from the Feywild. They could command the beasts of the fey realm just as mortal nobles could command their subjects. Renowned fey beast tamers, many of whom have been immortalized in story and song, rode into battle with powerful denizens of the Feywild at their side.
	Generations passed, empires rose and fell, and wars came and went. Bloodlines that once had been strong were thinned out by centuries of marriage and expansion. The beast tamers who commanded armies of fey creatures died out, and every generation of their offspring grew weaker in their control over fey beasts until the ability was almost forgotten.
	Once every few generations, however, a mortal is born of parents who still have strong blood ties to the ancient beast lords. Such individuals grow up with the inherent ability to bond with fey creatures. Though many never realize their full potential, some discover-through chance encounters-that they can influence fey beasts by sheer willpower. These special mortals usually bond with a single creature, forming a connection that is as strong as the one shared by soldiers who serve together in battle.
	You are one of these rare individuals with an ability that reaches back to the dawn of civilization. You have formed a connection with a fey creature and can command it to aid you and protect you from harm. Over time, as you develop this bond further, you will begin to absorb the inherent magic of the creature and find yourself capable of things you never thought possible.

Among the fey races, particularly elves and eladrin, powerful noble houses have arisen over the years as the authority in the Feywild. The various fey courts, including the Summer Queen's Court of Stars, are made up of representatives from these houses. Although the houses vary in makeup, goals, and methods, their members are collectively known as Sidhe lords-a title that paints them all with the same brush.
	The first true Sidhe lords were elves who lived before the great conflict that splintered the race into three factions. In the days when the race was in its youth, some ambitious elves claimed dominion over the untamed Feywild. When none could challenge them, these early Sidhe lords established themselves as pillars of power in the realm, and an order was born among the fey races. The common people showed deference to the Sidhe lords, and the lords protected those within their dominion.
	Later, as the people of the Feywild matured and the elf race split into elves, eladrin, and drow, a greater variety of Sidhe lords rose to prominence. Most of these were individuals of other races, such as drow and satyrs, who had gained influence and forged alliances. Rather than engaging in power struggles that could weaken their houses, the established lords acknowledged the new self-proclaimed nobles, giving them legitimacy. To this day, most of the Sidhe lords of the Feywild are eladrin (many of the elf lords took their power bases with them into the natural world), but the newer noble houses have offspring of other races.
	The noble houses of the Sidhe lords behave much as their counterparts do in the mortal world; they work together, come into conflict with one another, plot and manipulate, and meddle in the affairs of common people. The fey houses typically choose colors and heraldry the same way that human nobles do, but their symbols are fey creatures such as displacer beasts and owlbears.
	Most Sidhe lords are eager to associate themselves with dominion over an aspect of the Feywild. The Prince of Frost, for example, claims sovereignty over the Vale of Long Night, and he is known as the Sidhe lord who commands winter (at least, within the Feywild). Other Sidhe lords might hold sway over specific kinds of fey creatures (for example, displacer beasts).
	Formidable fey nobles make bargains with weaker beings or with those they favor. Sidhe lords have amassed a great deal of influence and arcane might, and a formal pact establishes a bond that allows a lord to transfer that power to a recipient. Many warlocks have such pacts, but Sidhe lords are free to enter into them with all kinds of creatures.
	You are a Sidhe lord, a representative of a noble house of the Feywild. Whether you are a youth or someone just coming up through the ranks of your house, your station affords you certain privileges. Moreover, you have the power and authority to make pacts, bargains, and accords as a Sidhe lord, and you can use your status to your advantage.

Legend tells of a great tribe of humans that settled the world in antiquity. Some say these humans were shapeshifters, born of primal spirits or fey creatures; others say they were the warlike children of a fey goddess. With valor and magic untold, they came from the Feywild in great vessels with sails like white wings. Wielding items of vast power, they conquered all opposing tribes (commingling with some of the elves they subjugated), carved out a realm, and ruled it for centuries. Eventually they fell into decline. The great race receded, its empire crumbled, and it withdrew into the Feywild, leaving behind fragments of glorious epics, hidden troves of magic, and the name of the mighty tribe: Tuatha. "The tribe"-for that is what the word meant in ancient Elven-dispersed throughout the land of the fey, where it is said its descendants remain to this day.
	Nowadays, any human or half-elf born or blessed with a strain of fey magic might be a tuathan. Most tuathans are born in the Feywild, and the bold vibrancy of that realm courses through their veins as it did in the tribe of old. Tuathans born in the mortal world are the result of brief human trysts with beautiful faerie folk. Such children are usually raised by the mortal parent in the natural world, and they grow up with little idea of their enchanted heritage. Deep in their hearts, however, they yearn to strike out into the unknown.
	Tuathans are compelled to experience more wondrous adventures than have ever been told in tales. Perhaps this urge is what drove the conquering Tuatha from the Feywild in ancient times, and perhaps it is the reason the tribe returned to the fey realm after ruling for so long. When tuathans set their sights on a distant horizon, a love to be won, or a challenge to be met, fulfilling the goal occupies their thoughts as intensely as the pangs of first love. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most fairy tales that migrate to the mortal world are stories of the tuathans of the Feywild striving to attain their heart's desire.
	Some tuathans bear no outward mark of their fey heritage and appear as ordinary humans or halfelves in every aspect. Most appear as slender, exotic individuals with striking, well-defined features and thick, lustrous hair. Their most remarkable physical characteristics are the slight suggestions of fey or animal traits that delicately grace their faces, notably eyes, noses, hair, and ears. Some have eyes like those of cats, eladrin, or owls; others have shining manes of dark hair naturally interwoven with raven, peacock, or eagle feathers; still others have subtly elongated noses or ears suggestive of foxes, cats, or elves. These understated traits appear natural and are rarely noticed at a glance.
	A few tuathans are fey shapechangers, able to transform into the beasts or birds that their normal features suggest. In ancient tales, shapechangers served tuathan kings and queens as explorers, spies, and court magic users. Today, such individuals travel the Feywild as trader nomads. They visit villages, towns, and cities of the natural world to give mortals a spark of magic in their lives-but always for a price.
	A vow or a bargain made with a tuathan is binding and cannot be broken without consequences, which are often magical. Tuathans believe that powerful enchantments are inherent in spoken stories, vows, bargains, rhymes, names, songs, and chants. For a tuathan, to say a thing is to give it life, to make it real.
	Tuathans believe that nothing in the world is unobtainable, and when they accept a challenge, they seldom back down from it. They pursue their aims to the ends of the world, for it is by the magnitude of their deeds that they will be remembered in song and story through the ages, like the Tuatha of old.
	Tuathan naming conventions date back to the time of the ancient tribe. Most of the names bestowed upon children have their roots in the land from which Tuatha set sail. Popular male names include Bran, Cadeyrn, Dylan, Eogan, Gawain, Iago, Lugh, Maedoc, Merrion, Morcant, Padraig, Roderick, Taliesin, Trystan, Urien, and Wynn. Females are often called Alis, Anwen, Blaithin, Cara, Ceridwen, Elain, Fflur, Glynis, Gwendolyn, Gwyneth, Keelie, Kendal, Megann, Morrigan, Rowena, or Sioned.

The Feywild is a place of magic and enchantment, but within its shadows lurk creatures of mischief, malice, and malevolence that are the source of horrific campfire tales told about the plane. At best, these dark fey, or Unseelie, are indifferent about the harm they cause with their actions. At worst, they are creatures that carry the taint of shadow magic and seek to snuff out the light of the world.
	Despite their reputation, these fey attract outsiders seeking their favor-some people just cannot resist the lure of dark magic. The Unseelie are well versed in the shadowy arts and, like many other fey creatures, love the power of bargains. They haggle and barter for what they have to offer, sometimes taking more than the seeker wants to pay in exchange.
	You are one such seeker. You came to an Unseelie fey creature in search of knowledge, favors, a weapon, a charm, or something else. The asking price was too high, so you pledged yourself into your patron's service instead. As is the case with many fey pledges, the duration of your service seems open to interpretation. In the meantime, you act as an agent of your patron well beyond the borders of its dominion.
	The tasks that your Unseelie master asks you to perform do not seem suspicious, and they follow no pattern that you have been able to discern. In fact, most of what you are called to do seems trivial- delivering messages, transporting money or goods, and reporting back on individuals that you observe. Your patron has yet to ask you to do something truly odious, although you realize that such a request might be made one day.
	In exchange for your service, your Unseelie patron bestows gifts upon you. At the outset of your bargain, your patron gave you a shadow-wrought weapon, a magic item that cements the bond between you. In addition, your master occasionally teaches you small magic tricks or gives you insight into the workings of higher fey powers, expanding your knowledge and expertise. You worry, however, that every gift you receive leaves you further indebted to the Unseelie fey creature, and you fear that it might be difficult, perhaps impossible, to free yourself from its grasp.

To become a feywarden, you must suppress the innate capriciousness of your kind. Threats to the kingdom are manifold, and the High Lady demands much of her champions. Only when it is time for Sarifal to retreat once more beyond the twilight veil can a feywarden relax his vigil. Heed the principles of your noble eladrin matriarch, and you might earn the High Lady's appreciation.
	You are never completely at ease beyond the wilderness. Most feywardens run in a loosely organized party with the eldest serving as the leader. Rare individuals, such as yourself, are sent beyond the verdant confines of Sarifal to gather intelligence on the kingdom's enemies.
	Feywardens are guardians of Sarifal and all things that dwell there. Your principal enemies are denizens of the Feydark who seek to despoil the pristine lands under your protection. You distrust humankind, seeing their attempts to tame and clear the wilderness as wasteful. You have a deep reverence for the primal spirits that watch over the Moonshaes, the Earthmother in particular.
	Outsiders regard feywardens as curiously introverted and evasive. Most feywardens are unaligned or good. Few fey realms are subject to the same sort of dagger-in-the-back power struggles that often erupt in human kingdoms, but agents of the Unseelie fey are ever watchful for opportunities to lure feywardens into temptation and ruin.

Callidyrr stands as a beacon of hope in a region overrun with malevolent fey, marauding giants, and bloodthirsty lycanthropes. As a Callidyrr dragoon, you are a stalwart defender of the realm, a privileged member of the High King's elite guard. Dragoon is a special title awarded to individuals who have shown exceptional service to the crown.
	Unlike knights of the realm, dragoons do not muster with the realm's army but instead receive assignments best handled alongside a small number of compatriots. As such, Callidyrr dragoons receive specialized training in diplomacy and espionage. Dragoons have access to the Palace of the High King and can speak with royal authority throughout the realm. In exchange for these privileges, a dragoon must swear a binding oath of unwavering allegiance to the High King and the land. The Royal Hierophant administers this oath and seals it with a geas that binds the dragoon to the honored ancestors. If the dragoon ever forsakes the vows to king and country, the geas irrevocably wipes the fallen dragoon of his memories.
	The rank of dragoon is relatively new, having been born of the nation's conflict with Amn at the dawn of the century. After repeated failed attempts to forcibly liberate the kingdom of Westphal from Amnian occupation, High Queen Alicia Kendrick founded the dragoons to work against the Amnian invaders clandestinely.
	When the High Queen died unexpectedly in the Year of the Halls Unhaunted (1407 DR), the dragoons were instrumental in quelling insurgent uprisings throughout Callidyrr. Common belief held that agents of Lionel Carrathal, heir to the former royal dynasty of Callidyrr who claimed to be the “true” High King of the Moonshaes, poisoned the beloved High Queen.
	In the years since, the dragoons have thwarted countless assassins, driven off sahuagin incursions, and even brokered a tenuous peace with the fey of Sarifal. This proud legacy is what you inherit as a Callidyrr dragoon. May you live up to its valorous ideal.

The Wild Hunt is a supernatural horde that, from time to time, tears through the lands at breakneck speed for days or weeks in pursuit of its quarry. The presence of the Wild Hunt is felt most strongly in the Feywild, but it sometimes appears in the natural world. No qualification or ritual is necessary to join the Wild Hunt. A rider might be a member of a hunting tribe in either the Feywild or the natural world, a normal person swept up in the glory of the hunt, or someone who made a deal with an impetuous fey lord. When the Wild Hunt appears, each of its riders suddenly vanishes from the world and becomes a member of the horde wherever it might be. The rider reappears at his or her former location days or weeks later with little memory of what happened-just flashes of rage and hunger, embodying the thrill of the hunt. No one on the hunt ever remembers what was being hunted or why.
	Firbolgs, giant-sized hunters from the Feywild, make up much of the rank and file of the hunt. When the firbolgs accept a Wild Hunt rider into their numbers, that individual also becomes an honorary member of the tribe. This is not a choice the firbolgs make; they simply sense that the rider belongs. The hunt is driven by a deeper magic that follows no rules mortals can understand, and those in the hunt know better than to try.
Creating: The Wild Hunt selects its riders; no one can join the hunt by seeking it out. Rangers, barbarians, druids, and other primal characters could easily find themselves swept up by the call of the hunt, but any sort of other character could discover just how strong his or her hidden instincts to hunt and kill truly are.
	Characters who have much in common with firbolgs might end up in the hunt. This group includes unaligned characters and worshipers of the three deities the firbolgs revere: Sehanine (the Maiden), Melora (the Mother), and the Raven Queen (the Crone).

Like the misshapen fomorians and their cyclops servants, an oracle of the evil eye has a deformed eye with a catlike iris. The eye grants the oracle influence over the minds of other creatures and the ability to see glimpses of the future. People fear and shun anyone with an evil eye, and often rightly so.
	The Baleful Ritual of the Evil Eye causes an evil eye to appear. This ritual-known to the fomorians, some of their servants, and a scattered few hags and spellcasters-takes hours to perform and is extremely painful, involving burning oils, foul incense, and surgical incisions. Fomorians, well known for their wickedness and insanity, might order that the ritual be conducted for many reasons. A ruler might give an evil eye as a gift to a faithful servant one day, then issue one as a punishment to a prisoner the next.
	Only the cruelest creatures consider gaining an evil eye to be a blessing. Evil fey such as quicklings and spriggans thrill at the power of an evil eye, and eagerly do the work of the fomorians in exchange for such a blessing.
	Most oracles of the evil eye who undertake adventuring careers are gnomes or eladrin. Forced to undergo the ritual, they become outcasts from their home societies. They go off into the woods of the Feywild, never to be seen again, or they travel to the natural world to lurk on the fringes of society and use their evil eyes to get what they want. An oracle of the evil eye might be adventuring in search of a way to dispel the curse and return to the warmth and comfort of society.
Creating: Oracles usually come from races hated by the fomorians, particularly gnomes or eladrin. However, anyone who has spent time in the fomorians' underground realms could have been subjected to the Baleful Ritual of the Evil Eye. The magic has even made its way into the hands of creatures outside the fomorians' domain. An adventurer who became an oracle without ever leaving the natural world might have run afoul of a strange witch in the woods, or stumbled upon a bizarre cult ritual, and thus been cursed with an evil eye.

Personal gain motivates the black-hearted knave. Scoundrels of the highest order, these cunning, untrustworthy villains exploit, betray, and deceive, having little concern for the people they hurt and the lives they destroy. Knaves encompass a wide range of characters, from the charlatan foisting colored water off as a cure for ills to the charming rake who steals hearts and purses in equal numbers. Turncoats, bandits, and public figures might be knaves in secret, masking their true intentions behind facades.
	One does not make a career of double-crossing and exploiting people without risking consequences. Rather than advertise their villainy, many knaves go to great lengths to stay above suspicion. A good disguise is sometimes all a knave needs. Fabricating a history, adding possible relations, and becoming established in a community gives the knave freedom to pursue his or her goals. Others work their trickery by being exceptional liars. A ready story and a convincing manner can divert a skeptic's attention elsewhere.
	Black-hearted knaves don't put down roots. No matter how many safeguards they have in place, a simple gaffe or a glimmer of recognition by a prior victim is all it sometimes takes to expose a knave for what he or she truly is. Adventuring provides a knave with a ready excuse to move from place to place. Between expeditions, he or she works schemes in whatever town or hamlet that has the bad fortune to serve as a host to the knave. Then, before anyone grows the wiser about what has been done, he or she moves off, drawn toward the next dungeon and adventure.
	The black-hearted knave lurks among almost every people and culture. The selfishness and cruelty required to become a black-hearted knave are in no way unique to any class or race; such peculiar villainy owes its origin to some terrible circumstance that set the individual on darkness's path. An ordinary man or woman might turn to skulduggery after being used by another villain in the past, thus becoming embittered and cynical. A hard life on the streets can corrupt one's good intentions and stain a soul with darkness.
	
	Most knaves benefit from strong personalities. Witty or menacing, inspiring or magnetic, they manipulate people around them. The talents of the bard make such characters eminently suited to become black-hearted knaves. Not only do they have the requisite charisma, but they can supplement their devious nature with manipulative spells to ensure that people around them behave as they wish. Rogues also possess skills and exploits that are perfect for expressing and reinforcing the knave's preferred methods.
	Other characters can also do well as knaves. Fey pact warlocks and enchanters incorporate magic into their techniques whereby they bend minds to their wills. A power-mad sorcerer might sacrifice others to hoard magical knowledge and baubles, while a disgraced knight or paladin could use a knave's techniques to make his or her way in the world after some public shame. Regardless of class, the black-hearted knave character theme is probably an inappropriate option for good or lawful good characters and should be limited for use by unaligned or evil characters.

Given the vital role that religion plays in many societies and the number of people who venerate gods, cults could find wider acceptance in the general population. After all, cults honor a higher power, a greater good, or a treasured ideal.
	What sets a cult apart from other religious institutions is a fundamentally bad belief, a perception about the cosmos that is diametrically opposed to those held by right-thinking folk. A cult's creed could be based on an extraordinary interpretation of a god (any god, even a good one) that compels certain sinister practices in their worship. Another cult might elevate a demon lord, monstrous alien, or dark power to divine status. Cults could be founded by devotees of beings that exist only in their minds. Such strange and deviant belief breeds dangerous behaviors and attracts the attention of forces that champion the good. As a result, most cults are driven underground.
	Cults spring up regularly the world over. Fear, uncertainty, and dissatisfaction foment offbeat beliefs and unwholesome ideas about how the world works and what the future holds. Cult leaders prey on doubts and superstition, drawing the disaffected and the despairing under their inf luence. One by one, adherents are brought under the cult's sway, abandoning families and work to find the salvation promised by following the one true path.
	Few cults subscribe to peace and harmony. Such rewards must be earned, a task that is impossible to realize in the present state of affairs. Therefore, cults are subversive societies, working against governments and widespread faiths, all to attain whatever objective the cult was founded to achieve.
Building a Cultist: When you choose the cultist character theme, spend some time thinking about the group and your affiliation. Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with a suitably interesting and dark society. Be sure to establish who or what it is that you serve and what it wants. Then, think about how you came to be part of the cult. How were you recruited? What were you promised? Once you joined, what responsibilities were you assigned? Are you one of the leaders or a devoted specialist follower? Have the higher-ups in the cult revealed the full extent of its power, or do they keep things hidden from you? Have your beliefs evolved since joining? Are you just as fervent as you were or have you become jaded about the organization?

Song and story profess that nobility carries a higher morality, that the aristocracy upholds honor, justice, truth, and valor. The hard truth is that this celebrated virtue is a myth-what distinguishes nobles from everyone else are the circumstances of their birth. Money, land, privilege: none of these things ensure good character and high ideals. In fact, such boons often create the worst villains.
	If the masses pierce the veil of pomp and circumstance and see the noble for who he or she truly is, that vaunted individual is bound to tumble from great heights to wallow in the filth of the fallen. As a result, the aristocracy works hard to preserve the illusion, to maintain at least the veneer of respectability. Waging war against scandal and rumor, nobles fight to preserve their lifestyles, their fortune, and their lives.
	No matter how cunning, some nobles succumb to temptation and forget their fragile position. Perhaps it was a careless moment, maybe it was a full assault on his or her character-no matter, the damage is done. A reputation, no matter how carefully nurtured, can be torn down in an instant. The fate of those nobles who topple, whose carefully constructed masks shatter, is one of disgrace and shame.
Creating: Choosing the disgraced noble character theme suggests some past crime or action that destroyed your reputation. Cowardice, corruption, deviant behavior, cruelty, and any number of other f laws might lead to your downfall. What caused your fall from grace? Are the accusations true or were they fabricated by your enemies? Have you lost everything or do you still possess some inf luence? What have you done to escape your enemies? What would you do?

Free will shapes the infernal slave's identity. Whether the decision was made after careful consideration or in the heat of passion, the infernal slave agrees to sacrifice the future-a dimly understood afterlife, a shadowy doom not yet realized-in exchange for some immediate gain.
	The boon could be something as base as wealth. Treasure chests filled to bursting, a prized jewel long coveted, a successful business venture: all translate into mortal comfort. The gain could be satisfaction of lust, carnal, material, or otherwise-a longing that would not be denied. The greatest lure, however, is power. Command over other people is intoxicating, as is the ability to do as one wishes without fear, without persecution, without regard for consequences.
	These prizes are great temptations. To the infernal slave, they are immediate and full recompense for a sacrifice payable far off in the future. Some claim that the slave is doomed to an unspeakable fate, suffering and dying a thousand deaths at the hands of the cosmos's most vile entities, those god-killers called devils. But what do the naysayers truly know. Maybe the consequences are far less dire. One never knows what the future holds. Given the immediacy of the boon and the remoteness (and sheer conjecture) of the payment, the infernal slave considers the arrangement a true bargain.
	In the end, an infernal slave comes to understand that he or she has bargained badly. The boon turns out to be fleeting, ruined by personal choice or circumstance. The bargainer becomes worse off than he or she was prior to making the deal. In this wretched state, the full horror of the pact is revealed and annihilation's imminence bears down with a hammer's force. The slave sees his or her doom in the shadows, hears the screaming souls as they burn in hellfire-a waking nightmare that never ends.
	At that point, panic and horror shape the slave's existence. Escaping this fate comes to eclipse any other consideration. In this way, the devils gain a mortal thrall-a vessel to spread evil and corruption. Evil appears the only way out for the misguided fool who desperately seeks to escape the doom he or she willfully accepted.
Creating: As usual when choosing a theme, several questions should be asked. What bargain did you make to become an infernal thrall? How did you contact a devil and what were you promised? Why did you accept the Faustian pact? Do you cling to the hope that you can escape it, or have you accepted your hellish fate?

Fingers of smoke claw at the sky from the burning village. The bones of shops and houses smolder in the attack's aftermath, crumbling as the flames consume them. Bodies, black with crows, twitch and jerk with each peck and tear. Another community ravaged. More lives destroyed. Death reigns, feeding the reavers' insatiable bloodlust.
	Ferocious reavers tumble out of civilization's fringes to plunder settled lands for food, goods, slaves, and mates. These grim-faced killers go about the bloody business of slaughter with a zeal that stops hearts and sends courage dribbling down their enemies' legs. They emerge from the darkness, sometimes in vast hordes on horseback or from dragon-prow longships. These fearsome howling warriors are bent on rapine and death, their cruel weapons rising and falling with a butcher's precision. When the reavers attack, none can hope for mercy or escape. They are purveyors of death, remorseless killers despoiling the world as they see fit.
Creating: Because reavers place such a high value on combat prowess, warrior classes are most common to this character theme.

Certain things mortals were not meant to know. These ideas are so foul and so obscene that to understand them is never to be clean again. The gods and devils recoil from such vile darkness. Even demons pause before its wicked majesty.
	Such considerations do not dissuade the vile scholar. He or she is not put off by disturbing concepts and horrid revelations. In fact, the vile scholar craves them, chases after them, and devours them.
	The vile scholar is often an intellectual drawn to dark study. Some seek out the forbidden to unlock the darkest and most dangerous secrets the world has ever known. Others accumulate vile knowledge from profane texts to transform themselves into liches, to destroy a god, or to locate some powerful artifact.

Eager to extend their influence into the world, the lords of the Nine Hells have long mingled their essence with those of chosen mortals to create bloodlines tainted with infernal power. Although the link between an infernal progenitor and his or her fiendish scions might stretch over many generations, the strength of the bloodline persists, and those "blessed" with such a legacy are potent tools of evil. Inheritors of a hellish strength, these infernal princes can call upon an array of diabolical abilities.
	Although many infernal lords have engendered mortal bloodlines, Asmodeus and Mephistopheles have been the most prolific. Infernal princes who can trace their lineage back to either archdevil are by far the most common of their ilk, and both Asmodeus and Mephistopheles actively involve themselves in the lives of their progeny. An infernal prince might be unaware that his or her blood and soul churns with the essence of an archdevil, and the diabolical power resulting from this union typically lies dormant until the character reaches young adulthood.
	In the case of an infernal prince bearing the blood of Asmodeus or Mephistopheles, a tutor sent by the archdevil arrives when the dark urges that herald a diabolical awakening manifest in that individual. This tutor is often a cleric or a warlock devoted to the archdevil, and his or her first order of business is to remove the fledgling prince from home and the influence of parents, who remain unaware of their child's ancestry because, for whatever reason, their own potential was never great enough to warrant the attention of an archdevil. The tutor's goal is to ensure that the student embraces his or her heritage and serves the archdevil whose blood flows through his or her veins. An infernal prince is still mortal, however, and the decision to embrace evil and follow in the footsteps of one's progenitors is his or hers to make. An individual must consciously choose the diabolical path to gain access to its power.
	Infernal princes can rise high in the service of the archdevil whose blood they share, and they are quite skilled at leading other mortals into darkness. Within an adventuring party, an infernal prince plays the part of a committed comrade and takes pains to keep his or her true allegiance a secret. The character works to lead companions into wickedness, subtly pushing them to commit acts of evil that seem innocuous but form a slippery slope into spiritual corruption. Once these companions are committed to evil, the infernal prince inducts them into the service of his or her patriarch, swelling the ranks of mortals who serve the interests of the Nine Hells.
Creating: Infernal princes come from many walks of life, since the lords of the Nine Hells value a diverse set of skills and powers. That said, characters who specialize in arcane or martial trickery and have access to powers with the fire keyword stand to gain the most benefit.

Many able-bodied men and women of Cormyr have taken the oath of sworn service to the Crown of Cormyr and earned the title of Purple Dragon. Although an exceptional few rise to knighthood and become Purple Dragon Knights, the Purple Dragons are those trained soldiers loyal to Cormyr who are ready to serve in times of war.
	All loyal citizens are eligible to take the oath of the Purple Dragon when they reach maturity. Those of noble lineage are expected to take the oath and typically are trained for positions of leadership, while those of a common bloodline sign up for two years of service in the militia and undergo extensive training.
	A lucky few are accepted as squires to Purple Dragon Knights. A squire's crest is emblazoned on a background of the liege's color, and these backgrounds are as numerous as the shades of the rainbow, though the purple dragon crest is never displayed on a black field. Those in direct service to the royal family and those who do not serve a particular noble bear their crests on a white background.
	Purple Dragons' training consists of three schools of focus. The young and fearless begin their study by learning attack techniques that bring the fight to the enemy. Those who dream of advancing through the ranks to take positions of leadership study tactics to best take advantage of the battlefield. The most respected are those who train to protect key personnel, especially War Wizards, and do not hesitate to sacrifice themselves for the greater cause. Regardless of role, the Purple Dragons train to fight together as a unit. Loyalty, duty, and honor are valued above all else, and a unit of Purple Dragons can operate as a single machine, utilizing the strengths of the working whole over the individual weaknesses of each component.
	Purple Dragons spend six months in extensive training. They are then assigned to a specific location to continue training while on active duty. Some receive assignments to serve in a major city and maintain the king's law; the largest such garrisons are in Suzail and Marsember. Others maintain border patrols as a first line of defense against Cormyr's enemies. After two years of service, some Purple Dragons choose the defense of Cormyr and enforcement of her laws as a career, but most return to their homes and professions until the need arises for them to bear arms in the name of the king. A rare few become adventurers, honing their skills so that they can be at their best when they are called back into service.
Creating: Loyalty to crown and country are paramount for a Purple Dragon, so there are no restrictions on class or race for citizens of Cormyr, who are mostly human. Non-native races often need to demonstrate their loyalty to prove their intentions before taking the oath.
	The Purple Dragons welcome any of good or lawful good alignment who take the oath to serve Cormyr and her king above all personal desires, and those who vow to protect all citizens of Cormyr. Betrayal of one's oath or another Purple Dragon is an act of treason. Those who enter into this vow lightly might one day dangle at the end of a hangman's noose!

Although any magician can create fire or force effects to hinder foes, a battle mage studies the art of maximizing his or her devastating effectiveness under the watchful eye of an established War Wizard. Those who truly master the craft might be invited to join the order of Cormyr's War Wizards, the elite battle casters sworn to the crown of Cormyr.
	The War Wizards of Cormyr are a secretive group. They realize that if the secrets they discover are shared only with those within their ranks, they gain an edge over their enemies. They reveal some of these secrets through research, and they find others in long-lost tomes of lore. Many War Wizards send their battle mage apprentices out with adventurers, with strict instructions to return and share any ancient secrets they might uncover. Like Purple Dragons, War Wizards and battle mages must swear an oath of fealty to Cormyr before training begins.
	Most battle mages are recruited as children when they show aptitude after being introduced to arcane theories or if they exhibit a natural talent for the arcane art. Some students who excel at their studies after being recruited are tested by a War Wizard and, if special talent is identified, they are taken from their families to learn at the War Wizard Academy. Only a few of those who achieve the mastery of basic arcane practices are admitted to the academy formally and are assigned to a particular War Wizard as an apprentice. The others are returned to their families. Having one's child selected to study with the War Wizards is considered a great honor.
	Once admitted, an apprentice spends five years studying the basic tenets of wizardry. Over half cannot achieve the high standards set by the War Wizards and are dismissed. After five years of successful study, an apprentice gains the benefits and official title of battle mage. He or she then studies additional secrets unique to the War Wizards.
	A few adults petition the War Wizards for an apprenticeship to learn their secrets and master their craft. The War Wizards are suspicious of such requests and turn away those who have not gained the full trust of the crown or proven themselves loyal citizens. Petitioners must undergo a series of divinations and other tests to verify their intentions. They must also prove their value to the organization by providing new knowledge of the arcane arts or by teaching a new and useful spell. Only then can a practicing wizard or sorcerer become the apprentice of a War Wizard. The expectations for all battle mages are the same, regardless of age.
	After becoming a battle mage, some thus titled request a sabbatical to travel the world so that they can learn mystical secrets to bring back to the organization and strengthen it.
Creating: Loyalty to crown and country is paramount for a battle mage. However, the War Wizards must also find value in the arcane arts that the apprentice brings to their organization. Only sorcerers and wizards can become Cormyrian battle mages.
	Any unaligned, good, or lawful good wizard or sorcerer who takes the oath to serve the realm, her king, and the War Wizards of Cormyr can become a Cormyrian battle mage. Breaking this oath is considered treason, and the organization will go to great lengths to prevent exmembers from revealing its secrets, most of which involve shaping spells on the battlefield and empowering spells to damage Cormyr's enemies.

Hailing from an ancient line of warlords and mercenaries, Sentinel Marshals are the quintessential elite in law enforcement in Eberron. Contracted to pursue criminals across national borders and beyond into uncivilized realms, they are an international police force dispensed by House Deneith. The Sentinel Marshals hold a reputation of honor, courage, and neutrality unrivaled by traditional chivalric agencies. Where royal courts, churches, and noble houses produce knights sworn to feudal lords, House Deneith produces knights sworn to the immortal ideology of a vanished kingdom. Their devotion to justice is second to none.
	The life of a Sentinel Marshal is far from easy, and even the men and women who meet its formidable standards seldom choose it. Most marshals travel constantly, work alone, and regularly cross blades with ruthless outlaws. More than mere soldiers of House Deneith, they are agents of justice and the law, warrior-diplomats who traverse physical and political hazards every day.
	Sentinel Marshals aren't flawless in their actions. They are, however, expected to be.
	
History and Marshal Law:
Nearly a thousand years ago, King Galifar III instructed the patriarch of House Deneith to form an elite order numbering no more than three hundred swords to assist the Galifar Guard in upholding the law. Further charged with bringing fugitives to justice, the Sentinel Marshals were assembled from the most venerated heirs of the house and became well known throughout the great kingdom. Many of these noble warriors were household names who others looked up to or feared.
	Where House Deneith was Galifar's shield, the Sentinel Marshals had become its blazing sword, striking down enemies of the realm within and without. Upon the death of King Jarot in 894 YK and the dispute over his succession, House Deneith and the Marshals struggled to smother the sparks of war. But when bloodshed could not be quelled and the Last War raged in earnest, the Marshals turned their efforts to the conduct of the war and universal observance of the Galifar Code of Justice, hoping to restore order when the kingdom was reunited.
	Galifar was not restored. Under the Treaty of Thronehold in 996 YK, which ended the centurylong conflict, the Marshals retained their role as officers of the Code. They were granted the right to cross national boundaries-hard lines that now divided the continent-to enforce the laws of the Code and punish those who defied it.
	As a branch of the world's most powerful mercenary organization, the Sentinel Marshals operate by contract. Although they are authorized to enact justice beyond the auspices of the dragonmarked houses, enforcing the Code of Galifar and even the Korth Edicts, they are not above the law.
	At first blush, Marshals-who are hired to capture or kill outlaws-might seem comparable to bounty hunters, but they live by an imperial oath and high moral standards. Yet Marshals are not expected to work for free; they might serve the ideals of justice, but the lords of Deneith earn lots of coin in the process.
	Marshals cannot be hired for just any mission. Only proven criminals or malevolent monsters are pursued, and if there is any doubt as to the target's guilt, Marshals might be instructed to arrest, not slay, their quarry. They are enforcers hired to track down criminals, not to determine guilt or solve mysteries, and yet justice is not always so easily served. Sometimes it begets investigation, and many Marshals, becoming invested in their work, make an effort to look beyond the obvious or readily apparent.
	Today, fewer than two hundred Sentinel Marshals exist. Only nine reside regularly in Sharn, the City of Towers, with three or four stationed in most major cities of Khorvaire at any given time. Their central offices are located in Sentinel Tower in the city of Karrlakton, and all Marshals inevitably return there to report, train, or receive new assignments.
	
Marshals and the Code:
The jurisdiction of the Sentinel Marshals is extensive but not without limit. The Galifar Code of Justice recognizes and protects the twelve sovereign nations acknowledged by the Treaty of Thronehold. Beyond these lands-in places such as Droaam, the Shadow Marches, and Xen'drik-a Sentinel Marshal carries only as much authority as he or she can exert. For example, a Marshal has the right to apprehend a criminal in Stormreach if the crime was committed on Brelish soil, but the Marshal should expect no support from the Storm Lords.
	The Code of Galifar includes laws that forbid murder, theft, assault, fraud, smuggling, dueling, the misuse of magic, and even treasure hunting without a letter of marque. Resisting arrest carries steep penalties, and Host save the criminal who dares to kill a Sentinel Marshal. The full wrath of the law will follow such a wrongdoer for life.
	The Code does not protect all creatures. It does not cover criminals (who forfeit all rights), the undead, and citizens of nations not recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold. For example, slaying a shifter from Graywall in the city of Sharn carries no penalty. The killing is not considered murder in the eyes of the Code because Droaam is not a sovereign nation.
	
A Marshal's Career Path:
Not everyone can become a Sentinel Marshal. Under normal circumstances, only blood members of House Deneith qualify. A dragonmark is not required, but those who possess one enjoy a measure of esteem that their peers must work harder to achieve.
	An heir of Deneith who aspires to become a Marshal usually begins as a member of the Blademarks Guild, then transfers to the Defenders Guild. Exemplary performance in both of those services earns an applicant consideration as a full-fledged Sentinel Marshal. A proven soldier must demonstrate honor, obedience to the chain of command, and dedication to the Galifar Code of Justice. Exceptions to this career path can be made, but only with direct sponsorship by one of the ruling lords of Sentinel Tower. Ultimately, it is merit, not age or family connections, that determines a Marshal's status. All Sentinel Marshals report to the Lords Seneschal and, nominally, to Baron Breven.
	
Signs of Authority:
A Sentinel Marshal is required to identify herself and her office when making an arrest. The uniform of a Marshal is a black or purple surcoat worn over armor. The cloth is sewn with silver thread and emblazoned with elements of the Deneith crest. Marshals are not required to wear this uniform at all times, but it's helpful when one needs to invoke one's authority.
	For times out of uniform, each Marshal is issued an elaborate badge of office. For one, it might be a special document sealed in a metal case. For another, it might be a brooch displaying the chimera heads of the Deneith coat of arms and worn as a cloak pin.
	When a Marshal has demonstrated exceptional service, her superiors might give her an honor blade. Honor blades represent the glory of House Deneith and the special veneration of the Sentinel Marshals. Such weapons are never sold, and a Sentinel Marshal who finds an honor blade in the possession of anyone other than a Marshal is required to recover it.
	
Adventuring Marshals:
Sentinel Marshals undertake many types of missions and have many reasons to travel. They receive assignments within Deneith enclaves throughout Khorvaire and sometimes beyond, such as in the house's Stormreach enclave. Between missions, a Marshal's time is her own. She can travel with allies provided that she checks in at Deneith outposts whenever possible.
	In times of crisis, Sentinel Marshals have the power to deputize worthy allies-especially other warriors or other members of House Deneith-to assist them. This title does not grant allies the full authority of a Sentinel Marshal, but it legitimizes their presence and recognizes their aid if the mission is later scrutinized. Depending on the circumstances, a Marshal's allies might be debriefed afterward, rewarded for their efforts, and asked to help again.
	A typical assignment for a Sentinel Marshal is to find (and kill, if necessary) a known and dangerous criminal. Such criminals are usually of the worst sort-the ones who leave town, consort with unsavory fellow outlaws, make fiendish alliances, and don't play fair.
	Sentinel Marshals are also special operatives, not just law officers. One might be asked to assist in a diplomatic mission to Droaam, seize a shipment of Xen'drik relics from pirates on the Thunder Sea, or save an Eldeen village from a dragon roused by the Lords of Dust.
	Having a Sentinel Marshal in the party provides an excellent plot device for the DM. Marshals also receive pay and rewards for each job they take, which is a means for your DM to deliver treasure. Baron Breven d'Deneith might have special items in his vaults or connections that can be used to reveal where such items might be found.
	The missions assigned to you, as an adventuring Marshal, are suitable for your skills and those of your known associates and regular deputies. If you are a rogue, you might be ordered to infiltrate a thieves' guild and slay the vampire lord that rules it. If you are a fighter, you might be sent to defeat an ettin terrorizing Breland's western borders.
	You're not always on duty, so you can go on adventures that have nothing do with your house. Nor are you required to chase down a cutpurse in the streets or arrest a merchant you see committing fraud unless you've been hired to do so. Yet you retain the right to enact justice whenever you deem it necessary. Some Marshals are callous about their authority, enforcing the law only in certain cases or when they're required to do so. Others cannot stand idle when they witness even the pettiest crimes. It's up to you to decide where you fall on the spectrum of justice.
	Remember that you don't have to kill every foe. Sometimes you're the good guy who drags the bad guys back to the city to face the music. But just as often, you need to be the judge, jury, and executioner who gets the job done by any means necessary. Usually, a fugitive's head is proof enough that he's no longer a threat.
Creating: Often, someone who seeks and gains admission to the Marshals spends his or her first few levels serving as a Blademark mercenary or a bodyguard in the employ of the Defenders Guild. For such a character, full-fledged membership in the Marshals might not be attainable before he or she reaches the middle of the heroic tier.
	That said, exceptions are possible. A 1st-level Sentinel Marshal in full standing probably has received special treatment, has strong family connections within House Deneith, and is dragonmarked. Such hasty advancement, though, could foster resentment among other Marshals and might present a roleplaying challenge.
	Only humans can be blood members of House Deneith, so Sentinel Marshals are always human. But again, the DM can make exceptions. A character of another race, if a loyal and long-standing servant of House Deneith, or one that bears the Mark of Sentinel, can earn honorary membership in the Sentinel Marshals with the approval of Baron Breven. Of course, a nonhuman Marshal might be regarded as an outsider among her peers.
	The Sentinel Marshal theme lends itself to characters who use the martial power source. Fighters, as skilled defenders able to go toe to toe with formidable enemies, are most common among Sentinel Marshals. Paladins, as defenders devoted to high ideals, also make excellent Marshals, although many struggle to balance their religious and secular duties. Rangers and rogues, trained to focus on a single quarry, are a good fit as well. Members of other classes, such as avengers and warlocks, are good at singling out specific foes and also work well as Marshals.

Encounters between demons and mortals end almost always in swift death for the mortals. Demons live to destroy everything they can until they are destroyed themselves. This violent behavior makes it rare for demons to consort with mortals, yet here and there across the planes, one can find mortals who have demonic blood flowing through
their veins. Called demon spawn, most such creatures display wild, destructive evil similar to that of their demonic sires.
	Unraveling the mystery of how demon spawn come to exist requires some background about how mortal races interact with the Abyss. Lolth instructed her chosen people in demonology ages ago, and her priestesses sometimes call forth demons to sire draegloths with willing initiates. Similar ceremonies might be found in other dark societies. Other kinds of demon spawn descend from incubi. Sages believe that incubi were devils that followed Graz'zt into the Abyss when he sought to conquer its first layer. Despite their new home, these incubi retain their basic nature, and they still trouble the natural world with nocturnal visitations that sometimes result in demon-blooded children. However, because the Abyss changes and corrupts all it touches, the most common way that demon spawn come into existence is through exposure to abyssal energy.
	Few demon spawn show evidence of their demonic heritage as soon as they are born. In fact, most look like normal mortal children, visually unremarkable. The transformation might start gradually, first with small horns breaking the skin on the forehead and later vestigial bat wings emerging from the shoulder blades. Demon spawn who conceal or downplay these features can avoid attracting attention or, if they desire, pass as tieflings.
Creating: Some demon spawn are little more than ravening monsters that wreak havoc in the world until some hero puts them down. A rare few find ways to control the corrupting influence that consumes them and channel it in constructive ways. Demon spawn are apt warriors, favoring classes that let them engage in hand-to-hand combat. Their unholy heritage makes them unpredictable in battle and, as the fighting rages on, they can lose the ability to distinguish clearly between friend and foe. For this reason, they focus less on defense and more on offense. Few warriors can match the ferocity that a demon spawn barbarian, ranger, or fighter displays.

Earthforgers wield great power, but such ability comes at an even greater price. When they grasp this elemental magic and take it in, earthforgers are reborn as elemental creatures.
	Dwarves pioneered the techniques of earthforging long ago; many sages believe that the race's first steps toward mastering elemental power occurred when the dwarves were enslaved by the giants, and those efforts led to the birth of the galeb duhr race. While extracting precious metals and gemstones from deep under the mountains, dwarf miners in that long-ago time came across primordial shards, crystallized magic left from creation. Using these shards, the dwarves found they could shape stone more easily, while also being able to endure even greater punishment. An unknown number of dwarves succumbed to elemental power's temptations, losing themselves to its magic, but enough resisted and proved mighty allies in the uprising that led to the dwarves' exodus from cruel enslavement.
	Other races have stumbled across earthforging under similar circumstances. Goliaths learned to use elemental earth from the stone spirits who watch over their mountain camps. Svirfneblin, gnomes who have long dwelt in the Underdark, use earthforging to evade drow slavers and destroy other hostile humanoids. Travelers report encounters with strange hermits, formerly mortal creatures that have been transformed into beings of living stone. Such individuals are rare, yet anyone who explores the wild places, those untamed lands where the primordials' fingerprints can still be seen, might very well come across an earthforger.
Creating: Not only can earthforgers increase their physical might by drawing power from the ground, they can use the same energy to shore up their defenses and resist injury. Some earthforgers pledge to protect others, taking up careers as battleminds or wardens to reflect their singular commitment to safeguarding their charges. In lands where mainstream religions have great sway, earthforgers might conceal their magical abilities, using them to supplement the fighting maneuvers learned from being a knight or a weaponmaster. An earthforger does not often pursue a divine career, but when one does, he or she favors the paladin class and worships Melora, Moradin, or Kord.
	Dwarves, goliaths, and other races with ties to mountains, hills, and subterranean environments have the oldest earthforging traditions, but a member of any race can learn the techniques. Earthforgers tend to have high Strength or Constitution scores and thus are more likely to emerge in races that have an advantage in these areas.

Elemental initiates follow a philosophy grounded in the understanding of the four elements and their influence over mortal bodies, hearts, and minds. One who would become an initiate withdraws from ordinary life to seek wisdom in a setting free of distractions, such as a monastery, a remote temple, or the dojo of a famous teacher. In some societies, the philosophy of the elements is widely known and respected as a path all should seek to progress along during the course of their lives. Among other cultures, these teachings are regarded as exotic or are unheard of. No matter the viewpoint of others, the path of the initiate is one of truth seeking and selfknowledge above all, a lifelong search for meaning and understanding.
	Before heading into the world, most elemental initiates lead ascetic lives. They own little more than the robes on their backs, and they eschew luxuries and intemperate behavior as distractions from the path to which they devote themselves. An initiate strives to curb passions rather than allowing those passions to rule. An elemental initiate might be a student who preserves ancient tomes, a martial arts disciple who studies the four elements, or an anchorite absorbed in the exploration of the mind in the wild and lonely places of the world. Philosophically minded initiates devote hours each day to study, discourse, and observation of the world around them, while others dedicate their time to meditation and exercise. In and around the daily discipline of the monastery or temple, common chores and tasks are shared among all members of the order.
	Typical elemental initiates are content to remain in their hidden temples and remote monasteries all their lives, devoting themselves to the study of their philosophy. However, some believe that they must travel widely, to pass on their learning and to absorb new lessons from the world outside the monastery walls. Other initiates take up a life of humble service, using their unusual training and abilities to help others. Adventuring elemental initiates come from the latter two camps.
Creating: Many kinds of characters might begin their training in monasteries, dojos, or isolated temples. Monks and battleminds are especially likely to do so. Characters as diverse as assassins, swordmages, and wizards can also flourish in cloistered environments where a student can focus on mastering a rare and difficult art. Some races and cultures, such as the githzerai, possess strong monastic traditions and make a point of training their most promising youths in secluded environments. Githzerai society is almost entirely organized around monasteries devoted to elemental study and in the Elemental Chaos. Any githzerai character could be an elemental initiate, regardless of class or background.

Fire creates and destroys. With fire, one can transform raw iron into a useful blade, clear a field of crops to halt the spread of a disease, or lay waste to anything that stands in one's way. Fire is also the element of emotion, of passion and intensity, of new ideas and revelations. Firecrafters embrace elemental fire, using it to forge themselves into something new, something made from fire and yet bound in humanoid form.
	Firecrafting finds its roots among the primitive cultures in the world. Legend holds that the primordial Imix gifted mortals with fire in order to destroy them, and it was Ioun's intervention and knowledge that gave mortals the wisdom to control it. Ioun enabled mortals not only to use fire for light and warmth, but to bend it to their will with magic.
	Firecrafters come by their power through the same channels that other individuals learn to use elemental magic. Some might transform into elemental creatures after discovering a primordial shard. An imprisoned primordial might grant a boon to a particularly loyal follower, while mere exposure to the Elemental Chaos could be the catalyst that awakens a latent elemental quality in others. Regardless of his or her history, a firecrafter leads a lonely life. People fear firecrafters, and with good reason.
Creating: Considered the most dangerous of the elemental arts, firecrafting lets an individual channel uncontrolled elemental fire into the world. Reckless usage often produces tragic results, with innocents burned or maimed for being too close when the fire slips free. This said, firecrafters learn to control their flames in time. Firecrafting intensifies an individual's emotions, leading most firecrafters to be rash and violent. Most seek occupations that provide an outlet for their aggression and thus become barbarians and slayers. Others find that elemental fire can boost magical ability, and many firecrafters have gone on to find great success as mages, psions, and warlocks. Divine firecrafters are almost unknown; they tend to follow Ioun.

Air, earth, fire, and water eclipse the other expressions of elemental essence found in the Plane Below. They are, after all, the most dominant forms, and most elemental creatures incorporate one or two of these fundamental elements into their being. Less prominent elemental provinces include all manner of phenomena from magma to ice, and smoke to metal. Although devotees of these lesser forces might be rarer than others, they are no less capable than other users of elemental magic. The ironwroughts prove this fact time and time again.
	The first ironwroughts appeared not long after human empires extended into the Elemental Chaos. Faced with teeming demons, mad slaads, and hostile elementals, as well as physical changes the settlers experienced after being exposed to the plane, the best warriors filled their time perfecting fighting techniques. The heavy armor, the metal weaponry, and their iron resolve all inclined them toward the lesser-known province of elemental metal. It took no time for these warriors to adopt metallic characteristics, becoming less human and more like the creatures they were sworn to fight. Calling themselves the ironwrought, they proved instrumental in throwing back the elemental hordes long enough for their people to establish colonies.
	From these early warriors descend the ironwrought societies still found across the Elemental Chaos and in the natural world. Two of these, the Scions of Steel and the Iron Brotherhood, actively recruit novices to train in the mystic arts. These warriors hire themselves out as mercenaries across the planes, selling their swords to whoever can afford the fee. Their reputation for excellence keeps these battle groups in constant employ, and they can be found fighting for the efreets, guarding caravans, standing watch on the walls of githzerai fortresses, and elsewhere on the plane and beyond.
Creating: Ironwrought adventurers come from the ranks of warriors, especially those who favor heavy armor and military weapons. Combat training establishes the proper mind-set for gaining and using elemental metal's power. Fighters, some paladins, and battleminds have the needed talents to merge elemental magic with their particular fighting art. Ironwroughts make strong battle leaders, and some of the greatest examples come from the ranks of warlords, runepriests, and ardents.
	You might have stumbled onto your heritage by some stroke of fate (good or bad). Maybe you learned to use elemental metal by joining an ironwrought society that shepherded you into your new nature through a mystical ceremony, altering your course forever. Then again, you could be a native of the Elemental Chaos who acquired your talents naturally from the wild plane.
	Although the ironwroughts originated in humanity, any humanoid who has the discipline and fighting skill can join ironwrought ranks. Ironwrought masters accept students who demonstrate physical prowess, toughness, and speed. Genasi, dwarves, halforcs, and goliaths all fit the bill.

The races of geniekind have a reputation for carrying off mortals to serve as slaves in the cities and palaces of the Elemental Chaos. Few mortals realize, however, that being the slave of a genie is far from an unpleasant existence. These servants lead lives not much different from those of the common workers, servants, soldiers, and artisans found toiling in and around the castles and palaces of nobles in the world. Even the most ordinary genie-whether dao, djinn, efreet, or marid-fancies itself a great lord with a high and royal title. It regards the everyday business of administering its estates and overseeing its property to be a task utterly beneath its attention. Instead, these genie overlords leave most of their affairs in the hands of a select caste of trusted, loyal slaves known as janissaries.
	Some janissaries are part of a genie's household staff and have little freedom to travel, but most large genie cities and realms are host to a whole class of janissaries who are considered slaves of the throne, rather than of a particular genie. Most such janissaries serve as elite soldiers, city officials, or highly valued artisans and engineers. They are allowed to own property, bear arms, travel, marry, and engage in whatever pursuits they like, although most are guards or bureaucrats in the ruler's service. Adventuring janissaries usually come from this group and are free to do as they please-until a high-ranking genie commands a service from them. It's not unusual for janissaries to venture into the mortal world on various errands, then stay on to seek their fortunes when their original mission is completed.
	Although janissaries are often rich, comfortable, and entrusted with great authority, they are still subject to the whims of their genie masters. Goodnatured genies, such as djinns and marids, treat their janissaries well and bestow honors and offices on servants who show cleverness, reliability, and efficiency. Daos and efreets, on the other hand, are cruel and overbearing, so they naturally value servants who use brutality and viciousness when attending to their duties. In most realms janissaries enjoy at least some legal protection against poor or capricious treatment, but in return they are expected to police themselves stringently and to comply with any order or request a genie gives them.
Creating: A janissary might come to hold many different offices and perform a number of duties, but an adventuring janissary is, first and foremost, a warrior who helps make up the core of a genie's entourage or army. Therefore, most such janissaries are fighters, warlords, battleminds, or other characters who are expressly suited for military service. Genies have little patience for characters who show devotion to entities other than themselves, so it is unusual to find cleric or paladin janissaries. However, wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, and swordmages are almost as common as martial characters among the ranks of janissaries. Skilled spellcasters are highly prized as guards and advisors.

Thousands of otherwise ordinary mortals live among the wonders and perils of the elemental plane, inhabiting isolated citadels that loom atop drifting earthmotes or thronging trade-towns standing on the shores of exotic seas.
	Mortal denizens of the Elemental Chaos, known as moteborn, often leave their homes behind and seek their fortunes elsewhere. A moteborn's reason for doing so might be anything: Catastrophe sometimes destroys an elemental realm, leaving its survivors scattered and homeless. A criminal, whether guilty or falsely accused, might flee to avoid punishment. Someone whose culture values personal honor might go into exile when dishonored, hoping to spare family and friends from disgrace. Other moteborn are people of status in their native domains, and such moteborn travel and adventure to prove their worth.
	Depending on how and why a moteborn leaves his or her elemental home behind, he or she might wander the Elemental Chaos in search of wealth and power, or search for a new home in the natural world where he or she can win high station. Another moteborn might be an exile hiding from enemies back home, taking a false name and traveling to keep ahead of pursuers and assassins.
Creating: Because scores, perhaps hundreds, of separate mortal domains are scattered across the vastness of the Elemental Chaos, a moteborn might belong to any race or class. Any character who hails from an exotic homeland and demonstrates a knack for self-reliance and far traveling is suited for this theme.

Most mortals give their devotion to the gods, but other powers that crave worship dwell in the cosmos. A primordial adept is a cultist, a seeker after hidden knowledge, or a member of an esoteric order who turns away from the deities to worship one of the ancient primordials.
	In some places, adepts are considered to be religious individuals and occupy the same role in society that divine priests do. Like priests, adepts are initiated into their powers; some establish their bond with their patron under the tutelage of a cult or a secret society, participating in ceremonies designed to mark their accession to the organization's inner circles. Other adepts forge their bond with their patrons by devising their own rituals of binding and command.
	Some adepts think of themselves less as priests and more as scholars and delvers into the unknown. They seek out the writings of older primordial adepts in hopes of mastering a source of power that most other scholars wouldn't dare to unearth.
	All primordial adepts have many of the same goals: the mastery of elemental power, the accumulation of knowledge and lore, and the continuing favor of their inscrutable patrons. An adept becomes an adventurer to explore places of ancient power, recover lost knowledge, and (more rarely) advance the causes and designs of his or her elemental patron.
Creating: Primordial adepts are characters of unusual intelligence, zeal, or force of personality. Delving into secrets that mortals were not meant to know is not a calling for the fainthearted. Arcane characters such as sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards are drawn by the lure of hidden lore and make excellent primordial adepts. Divine and primal characters very rarely pursue this path, since taking a primordial for a patron is incompatible with wielding divine energy or serving the primal spirits. However, some gods have strong ties to the elements (for example, Melora, Moradin, and Tharizdun), and a cleric or an invoker devoted to the elemental aspects of a deity might fit this theme.

The versatility of elemental water manifests in the talents of the watershapers. These elemental devotees can wield water as a weapon, sending waves crashing into their enemies. With experience, a watershaper can discover water's subtler aspects. Such a master can use water to touch other minds, ease suffering, and alter one's appearance to stave off age or conceal one's physical connection to the Elemental Chaos.
	Of all the expressions of elemental power in the world, the art of watershaping was not an accidental discovery. Most who know of it see it as a blessing from the kindly primordial Ben-hadar to ease the suffering created by the Dawn War. Some skeptics suggest that the "gift" was nothing more than a way to help the primordials maintain a foothold in the natural world. Regardless of the motive behind its existence, watershaping has helped mortals travel around the world by enabling them to brave the ocean's surface and explore its depths. All waterfaring people count themselves lucky if they have a watershaper in their midst.
	Watershapers operate as advisors, envoys, and arbitrators in the communities they live in or near. They keep the peace, urging calm in their fellows. As reasonable and diplomatic as watershapers can be, they have a stormy side. When one is roused to violence, he or she can be a dangerous adversary.
Creating: Halflings, not surprisingly given their association with rivers and lakes, produce more watershapers than any other race. But the riverfolk do not share  their secrets with other peoples, and an outsider must find some other way to learn watershaping. A primordial shard, especially one found at the bottom of a still pond or lodged in the rocks below a waterfall, might offer its possessor a relatively easy way to become a watershaper.
	Aside from halflings, humans and elves are next most likely to learn this craft. As great explorers, humans brave the seas, searching for new lands and peoples. Elves honor the wilderness and might discover the power of elemental water in a sacred stream or a pool in a remote part of a forest.
	Anyone with an interest in commanding the waves-even someone who has no previous life in or on the water-can nurture that interest and develop into a watershaper. Although any watershaper can become a warrior, and many are vaunted combatants, others find the talents they have cultivated are best used to aid the injured and bolster companions, contributing toward completing a shared quest in ways other than swinging a sword. Watershapers who adopt this lifestyle are almost always bards, since they can help their comrades and learn spells that take advantage of their water manifestations. A watershaper might also be a shaman, a druid, or, rarely, a cleric of Melora.

The mantle of the windlord is taken up by those who devote themselves to mastering elemental air, able to manipulate any expression of it from the lightest breeze to the most terrible gale.
	A windlord might be a mortal who has pledged fealty to a primordial such as Chan, Yan-C-Bin, or another figure associated with elemental air or storms. Other individuals come to master the talents of the windlord after discovering a primordial relic or being transformed during an extended foray into the Elemental Chaos.
	In some histories, the earliest windlords were eladrin mages who discovered how they could use elemental air to supplement their magical training. Legends go on to say that once these mages mastered the higher mysteries, they lost their fey heritage and soared through the air as eagles. Some claim that they still watch over the eladrin cities today, always circling, always vigilant until the day when they are vitally needed.
	Other accounts hypothesize that the djinn handed down the secrets of becoming a windlord to mortal allies who had earned their trust. Support for this claim is found in frescoes in the ruined city of Badalada, perched atop a f loating earthmote in the Elemental Chaos, that show djinn carrying what are obviously humans, elves, and other races through the air and teaching them to f ly. If there were such connections between these races, they are long dead now, since the djinn presently show little interest in forging bonds with the people of the natural world.
	A windlord who strikes out in the world does not go long without attracting a potential employer. One who does not pursue the life of an adventurer might find work as a spy or a scout. Being able to manipulate elemental air helps such an individual pick out sounds another person might not perceive. A windlord can hide on a high perch and monitor enemy movements, or find a path through the wilderness from the advantage of an aerial position.
Creating: Best known for their speed and mobility, windlords are agile combatants, darting through the air and supplementing their attacks with gusts that rush in from nowhere. Many windlords use hit-and-run tactics, similar to those that might be employed by monks, rangers, and assassins. Although elemental air does not increase an attack's potency, it does help a combatant get into a superior position from where he or she can attack.
	Mages, psions, druids, and others can use power over elemental air to make up for any shortcoming they might have in weapon use. With the increased maneuverability and defensive properties elemental air can provide, such implement wielders can better reach places where they can use their magic to the greatest effect.

The City of Brass in the Elemental Chaos is a complex net of social intrigue, woven through the courts of the efreet lords who stand as the city's masters. The feuds, alliances, and enmities of the city require a special class of citizen to navigate: the brazen ambassadors.
	Developed as a means for embattled efreets to communicate with their peers, brazen ambassadors have taken on a greater role, not just within the City of Brass but also on far-flung planes. Today, brazen ambassadors handle most of a lord's affairs, from negotiating alliances with the city's many courts to brokering with planar traders that come to the city. They even deign to represent Bashamgurda, Lord of the Efreets, and through him, the City of Brass itself.
	Each brazen ambassador is drawn from the ranks of slaves within the City of Brass, and the decision to elevate such an individual is not made lightly. The process requires potent magic, demanding the investment of an efreet patron's power. The efreet first draws off some of its burning blood, which a specially trained ritual practitioner, or sahaar, uses to tattoo arcane symbols on the skin of the chosen figure. As it cools, the blood leaves a brass filigree etched into the ambassador's skin. This initiation is dangerous; the frail do not survive. Adventurers are prized choices to become brazen ambassadors because they are far more likely to survive the process than any common slaveling.
	The markings on an ambassador serve two purposes. The first and most obvious is to distinguish a brazen ambassador as more than a mere slave. At a glance, an efreet can know that the words of such an individual are not the mere whining of a lowly slave- they are treated as the words of a peer. Second, the ritual causes the blood of the patron to intermingle with that of its ambassador, causing the ambassador to become a part of that efreet's bloodline. The connection between an ambassador and its patron is a potent one, permitting the efreet to invest an ambassador with some of its power, even across the planes.
Creating: A brazen ambassador must speak with unshakable confidence and quick wit; stories claim that such envoys are able to cause kings to doubt themselves. As the mouthpieces of their lords, ambassadors are expected to emulate the arrogance and certainty of the efreets. Bards and warlords are sought out for this ability, though anyone capable of constructing an entertaining enough lie could catch the attention of an efreet lord. Sometimes negotiations in the City of Brass are conducted at the tip of a sword, though, so it is also possible for members of martial classes to slip into the ranks of the brazen ambassadors. Of those, quick-witted rogues excel, since they can operate as assassins when demands go unmet and negotiations fail. Brazen ambassadors who use divine power are almost unheard of: Efreets are jealous creatures, and demand their servants follow no other master.

Throughout the mortal world and scattered among the planes, hidden pockets of the Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye work in secret to avoid persecution from those who do not understand their faith. The cult is a fragmented organization. Few members fully understand the forces they worship, but all have a common goal: to blur the lines between the mortal world and the Elemental Chaos. The various sects have different understandings of what will happen when they achieve that goal, but they all pursue it with equal fervor.
	One of the more unusual methods used by the cults to hasten the planar merging is the creation of the creatures known as chaosmade. Strange hybrids of mortal races and the Elemental Chaos itself, the chaosmade are living, breathing hosts of the disquieting forces of the plane. Wherever chaosmade walk, order is doomed to fall into disorder, and, little by little, the Elemental Chaos leaks into the world.
	The creation of a chaosmade is an exercise in potent magic, done in secret. The cult continually watches the offspring of its members to see if any bear the marks of chaos. These marks manifest in many ways, from an unusual birthmark, to a hatred for tradition, to an unrestrained spirit. These criteria change from one cult to another, but the outcome is the same. The cult takes the child to its inner sanctum, where it is reborn as a chaosmade.
	The high priest strips a portion of the child's soul away and plants in its place a seed of pure chaos, which in time will grow and flourish. This force feeds on the whims and urges of the individual, and in turn, it shapes those urges toward fomenting discord. In return, a chaosmade has access to immense power that, while it can be directed, is torturously difficult to control.
Creating: Wisely considered dangerous, a chaosmade is able to infuse any plane with the disquieting forces of disorder, calling upon the raw energy that rages within. Chaosmade who expose themselves to this energy face the risk of burning out from the power within their soul. Eventually, most will learn to restrain themselves, but some choose to let the chaos run wild, believing that it is their place to unfix the stagnant bonds of order wherever they find it.
		Chaosmade can pursue nearly any career, but many choose to enter professions that allow them to indulge in their chaotic nature. The lure of the arcane is seductive to a chaosmade, and many work as mages. Others feed the call for pandemonium with wanton destruction as barbarians or ferocious rogues. A rare few, though, attempt to quell the chaos within, seeking some fragment of order in their otherwise disordered lives by enrolling in organizations with strong structure and rules they can build their lives around. These chaosmade make potent fighters and warlords. The path of leadership is particularly seductive to young chaosmade. Within their cults, they were destined for positions of leadership, either as the heads of a cultist cells, or ordained as generals meant to lead armies of the faithful against the world.
		It is rare to find sorcerers, particularly those who wield wild magic, within the ranks of the chaosmade. The seed of chaos within a chaosmade's soul jealously consumes any other source of power, and any attempt to draw more fully on the Elemental Chaos is to invite disaster. A mortal form simply cannot withstand so much of the plane's raw energy, and the unlucky few who attempt to do so are twisted into horrifying creatures, shifting from one agonizing form to the next with each breath.

In the Elemental Chaos, merchants must transport valuable goods between cities in order to make a profit, and where there is trade, there are pirates who stand ready to acquire those goods. Stormraiders are a specialized class of pirates who strike the trade lanes of the Elemental Chaos aboard their fast lightning skiffs.
	Known for the suddenness and ferocity of their attacks, stormraiders lack any formalized structure. Instead, they have a loose fraternity built around a few common guidelines: "Help a raider crew in need," "Share in the plunder," and "Never betray a comrade before the mast" serve as the only laws of stormraider society. Petty disputes are resolved in bloody duels on the deck of a lightning skiff, usually surrounded by a cheering crew betting on the outcome. It is a hard and uncertain life, knowing no home but one's ship, with no safe port of call. Death can come quickly at the end of a sword, or slowly at the talons of a demon that is tired of losing its treasures to stormraider crews. The only havens known to stormraider ships are a few small pirate ports built on twirling earthmotes, where lighting skiffs can rest their crews, resupply, and repair their vessels. Still, many are willing to fight beneath the thunderhead-black flag of piracy. Escaped slaves from the City of Brass revel in the freedom they find in the stormraider's life, and pirates from the Riverweb seeking new adventures can readily find it on the deck of a lightning skiff. No matter the background of the individual, the life of a raider is one of constant momentum, quickly transitioning from one adventure to the next.
	Stormraider heroes regularly command the respect of the crews they serve alongside, often seeming to be marked for greatness. Aboard a lightning skiff commanded by a particularly bloodthirsty captain, these heroes are often the sole voice of reason, able to keep the captain from bouts of wanton and pointless slaughter. It is not unheard of for communities in the Elemental Chaos to hire adventuring stormraiders as privateers, or for lords to employ crews to raid the ships of personal enemies. The Elemental Chaos is full of opportunities, and clever stormraiders stand poised to claim them all.
Creating: There are many different reasons to become a stormraider. Some do it as a way to escape their past, others out of lust for treasure. So long as a raider can hold his own in raids, he is welcome aboard a lightning skiff. Most raids happen in tight quarters, and members of classes that favor hand-to-hand combat are common. Stormraider crews also use sharpshooters in the rigging to pick out officers or troublesome defenders on enemy ships, so rangers and warlocks are valuable to raider captains.
		Upon induction to a stormraider crew, all new members receive new names. This is because they are being reborn in a new family, with the captain as father, the ship as mother, and the crew standing in as a family of bloodthirsty brothers and sisters.

You always wanted to be a wizard. Your family did its best to indulge your dream, even when others told you that you would never amount to anything. You attended public academies and auditioned with private spellcasters, striving without success to master the techniques of an apprentice mage. Enchantment, evocation, illusion-every school of magic was a closed door to you. The simplest cantrips seemed to be out of your reach. You would have given up, but you were convinced that it was a matter of learning, not a matter of talent. If only you could find the right teacher.
	Having exhausted all other options, you presented yourself at the fabled Blackstaff Tower. The new archmage of Waterdeep and the master of Blackstaff Tower, Vajra Safhar, had issued an open call in search of apprentices. To your surprise, and that of Waterdeep's magical community, you were among those whom Vajra chose to train as one of her new corps of Blackstaff wizards.
	With your fellow apprentices, you embarked on an experimental path of study that demanded absolute understanding and mastery of magic's fundamentals before specializing in any one school. Under Vajra's unorthodox tutelage, you flourished. Then, on the eve of your first-year exam, Vajra vanished.

For over a thousand years, the Mad Mage Halaster Blackcloak ruled Undermountain, the labyrinthine dungeon beneath Waterdeep. During that time, he created untold numbers of clones to house his identity in case his body met with disaster. The clones were kept in stasis and hidden in safe places throughout Undermountain and the lower reaches of Waterdeep. Though Halaster expected death at every turn, not even he foresaw his destruction at his own hands. His essence was cast across the planes when he lost control of a powerful ritual, and before he could find his way back to one of his clones, the Spellplague struck. Only Halaster knows for certain what happened next.
	You were supposed to be one of Halaster's clones-of that much you're certain. The safe house in which you awoke was filled with the Mad Mage's writings, which were meant to help him reorient himself upon assuming a new body. But something went horribly wrong.
	You are not Halaster. Your body is far different from what is shown in the paintings and illustrations of the master of Undermountain. Your personality and skills seem drawn from another source. Yet Halaster is there too, his maniacal laughter bubbling up from the recesses of your mind.
	It has now been more than a hundred years since Halaster's death and the onset of the Spellplague, and you have nothing but questions. Undaunted, you set out from Undermountain to create a life and a history for yourself; you hope to find the strength to keep your internal madness at bay. Halaster's power grows with every passing day, and this body isn't big enough for both of you.

	While pursuing your duties in the Lords' Palace, you overheard a discussion among several of your fellow lords. Though their faces and voices were distorted by magic, their words left you chilled. Some among your fellow Masked Lords-you're not sure who or how many-have been assassinated, their positions and identities assumed by doppelgangers intent on taking control of Waterdeep.

The wilderness holds dangers aplenty for the unwary and unprepared. Savage humanoids gather in fell places to launch raids against caravans and homestead alike. Twisted monsters lurk in the shadows and deep caves. Old ruins harbor the spirits of old kings and warriors turned to evil. As dangerous as these realms can be, certain folk take it upon themselves to protect the world and innocents from these threats. From the fearless ranger who prowls the old paths to the druid who secures founts of primal magic from exploitation and ruin, such guardians fight on the front lines against the spreading darkness. Yet they do not fight alone. The legendary werebears emerge from their isolation to fight at their sides and uphold the ancient charge placed upon them by nature's divine protector.
	Werebears stand apart from most skinchangers. They lack the evil natures that compel their cousins to commit violence against mankind. Rather than grapple with the bloodlust and savagery so pervasive among the werebeasts, they retain their morality, in part from Melora's favor and also from the great task they accept as theirs. As Sehanine's curse spread through the werebeast clans, Melora reached out from her heavenly realm and sheltered the bear clan. They had ever been among her most devout servants and took no part in the misguided effort to steal the moon from the sky. In exchange, she commanded them and all their descendants to protect the world against their fellows' wickedness, to secure the wilderness against the despoiler and destroyer, and, above all, to keep alive the old ways of the world's magic.
	Although many werebears descend from the bear clan, others come by their lycanthropic natures in different ways. Rangers, wardens, and others might receive the gift of lycanthropy after performing a great service for the druids or for a nature spirit. Melora sometimes rewards favored priests with the ability to transform into bears after a demonstration of uncommon devotion.
	Regardless of the transformation's cause, werebears do not remain in civilized areas. They live alone in unspoiled forests and mountains. They construct crude shelters or settle in caves. And the lands and all the creatures living there for miles around fall under their protection. Werebears tend their lands and watch over their charges to ensure the natural processes are left undisturbed. Should anything or anyone threaten the lands they guard, the werebears respond with deadly force and lead the people and the beasts to destroy their intruder, fighting until no threat remains.
	Even though many werebears remain in their chosen lands, some do not settle in one place for long. They come to see the entire world as their responsibility. These werebears are the ones most likely to become adventurers, and they crusade against evil in all its forms. They take up with like-minded adventurers, preferring the company of individuals also connected to the spirit world.

They carry plague. They live in squalor and filth. They eat whatever they can, fouling foodstuffs and other supplies with their leavings. And they breed at an alarming rate. For these reasons, most folk consider rats vermin and it's no surprise that rat catchers patrol almost every city, venturing into the sewers and exploring the docks with dog and club to control the rat population. Whispers circulate among those who do this thankless job about the big rats that can break a ratter's neck with a single bite. And then some tell stories that no one dares believe: tales of rats who walk upright as humans.
	Wererats find no more welcome among other skinchangers than they do in civilization. Deemed the lowest form of werebeast, they have few opportunities to interact with other clans. Instead, they keep to their own kind and live with the rats whose warrens they share. More than any other lycanthrope, wererats live among human populations, hiding in plain sight and learning the secret ways in and out of the city to move about unseen when hunting. They claim the sewers, the abandoned buildings, and the slums, where witnesses are rare and reports about their activities go unheard. They are scavengers, picking through civilization's leavings and spreading their disease wherever they can.
	Despite the hostility toward wererats coming from all fronts, they not only survive, but also thrive. Wererats might be hated, yet they exist in the largest numbers. They might be rejected, yet they operate in extensive communities so that they do not need assistance or aid from other werebeasts. And although they might lack the ferocity or durability enjoyed by rivals, their swarms can overwhelm even the toughest werewolf.
	Since wererats live among humans, they have the best opportunities to pursue adventuring classes. Rarely, a wererat might change his or her views regarding humans and make efforts at restitution for past crimes, if not directly to improve the community, then indirectly to fight for other communities. A few wererats owe their natures to a chance encounter with another wererat or plague-bearing dire rat. Once the disease runs its course, the individual is uprooted and searching for a new future as a shapechanger.

When people think of lycanthropy, they think of werewolves. No other lycanthrope evokes the same fear, even if other lycanthropes might be stronger and more dangerous. Life on the frontiers puts settlers in contact with wolves and, having watched livestock vanish and having fended off attacks against ravenous wolves, the fears seem justified, even though most wolves avoid mankind when they can.
	Although ordinary wolves are content to go their own way, ranging across the countryside in packs, werewolves hunt humans. They and the wolves they enslave are aggressive, vicious, and unrelenting in their attacks. Werewolf packs are dangerous, since they can scout out the landscape by day in human form and launch attacks by night. They might be fearless in battle, but they avoid the cities where they face discovery and death. Instead, they keep to the wilderness, where their attacks might go unnoticed and where retribution comes slowly-if at all.
	As with all lycanthropes, being a werewolf is no guarantee of evil. The hunger remains, but a strong will can control it. It is always a struggle, though. A werewolf must always fight to keep the beast in check, and sometimes even the best efforts are not enough. Werewolves seeking redemption for or escape from their natures favor the adventurer's life since it carries them away from innocents and lets them vent their fury on more deserving foes.
	Nearly all werewolves inherited their natures from their parents, passing on what many would consider to be a curse. Such werewolves are human or have human blood, such as half-elves or half-orcs. Just about any other natural or fey race could become a werewolf by succumbing to moon frenzy or fall prey to a curse due to their bloodlust.

Evil emerges from below to work villainy on the innocent. Those of good heart stand against its machinations and struggle to rebuild in the aftermath of the conflict. For bloodsworn, though, guarding against wickedness is not enough. They take the fight to their enemies in a quest to destroy them all.
	Evil creates the situation that brings a bloodsworn into existence. Some terrible event sows the seeds of vengeance in an individual's heart, goading him or her to take up sword and staff to fight back against the darkness and ensure that evil never rears its head again. Often, bloodsworn are survivors of slaughters, whether from goblin marauding, a dark cult's sacrifices, or grimlock raids. Swearing bitter vows to the gods or to their dead comrades, bloodsworn travel a path of righteous vengeance.
Creating: Bloodsworn exist among all races, classes, and cultures. One tragedy is enough to set an individual on the path of vengeance. When creating a bloodsworn character, consider the following story elements.
Choose Your Enemy
Every bloodsworn has an enemy that defines him or her. You can choose any individual, creature, or institution to be your enemy. Think about who your enemy is, what it did, and why it did so.
	Tailor your training to better defeat that hated foe and counter its capabilities, tactics, and motivations. A bloodsworn who drives back orc hordes is very different from one who is committed to wiping out the Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye or one who has sworn to destroy giants. As you make decisions about feats, powers, and other game elements, keep your chosen enemy in mind and pick options to help you bring it down.
	Keep in mind your foe's level relative to your own. If you are pursuing dark elves, you probably won't encounter them until the heroic tier's upper reaches at the earliest. On the other hand, goblins will cease to be a meaningful challenge once you hit the paragon tier. Be sure to talk with your Dungeon Master to make sure your chosen enemy fits into the campaign's story and level range.
	You should also consider the scope of your vengeance. A limited goal makes defeating your chosen foe reasonable and achievable. Do you really want to exterminate all dark elves (an impossible task) or only the drow of House Eilserv?
	Finally, think about your character's life before the tragedy changed you. What did you want to become? What were your dreams? What did you value? Do you still hope to reclaim the life that was taken from you, or have you given up all such expectations, knowing the road you now walk leads only to death?
Vengeance's Inspiration
Your enemy could inspire the choices you make about your character. Consider deciding on your enemy before you select your class or race to guide you and suggest a character who best reflects your choice of adversary. If you prefer to choose your race and class first, those details in turn might suggest certain enemies.
	Many races in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world have natural enemies. The history of the fey folk pits drow against eladrin and elves. Dwarves fought giants and orcs in ancient times. Dragonborn and tieflings have good reason to hate each other. The reasons behind these conflicts could be lost in the past, but the animosity remains very much alive. Choosing an enemy that has strong ties to your race helps reinforce your character's place in the world.
	Just as race can help determine your chosen foe, your choice of class can suggest certain opponents and bring your character to life. Most classes have no particular animosities, but divine characters often pit themselves against servants of other gods. A priest of Corellon might vow to fight Gruumsh's servants, and the Raven Queen's paladins despise Zehir's priests. A psion or an ardent might venture into the Underdark to seek out a portal to the Far Realm and prevent a flood of monstrosities from reaching the world.
	An unexpected choice for your hated enemy can create interesting dynamics in the group. For example, everyone expects a dwarf to hate orcs and giants, but you might create a dwarf fighter who has sworn to defeat an Underdark merchant consortium that exploited your people and emptied their vaults.

Beneath the tramping of nations and the roots of forests is a world that surface dwellers can barely imagine. Countless tunnels and caverns, rivers and oceans form a fantastic, globe-spanning environment. To the unprepared, though, the underground wilderness is as ruthless as it is wondrous. Those who survive these wilds are among the greatest explorers in the world. For these deep delvers, an expedition to the Underdark is no more threatening than a stroll through the woods.
	Deep delvers are driven by an unquenchable desire to pit themselves against the challenges of the subterranean world. Some seek to map out the spiraling highway-tunnels of the Underdark. Others are naturally drawn to the seclusion of caves, preferring to abandon life on the surface. Yet others are born to the Underdark and still call it home.
Creating: Deep delvers are a diverse lot, united only by their will to thrive in the caverns they call home. Though deep delvers come from all races, few surface dwellers other than humans are likely to choose this path. Many deep delvers come from races native to the Underdark, such as dwarves and svirfneblin, who have a natural affinity for dungeoneering. Classes that specialize in survival  skills, such as druids, rangers, and rogues, also excel as deep delvers. Consider the following story elements when creating a deep delver character.
Born Above
If you belong to a race native to the surface, something uncanny must have inspired you to favor a life below ground-and to enable you to survive there. The Underdark's scope and geography are unlike anything aboveground. Think about why you decided to live below the earth, and thus how you approach its many challenges.
	Are you constantly in search of new sights and experiences? Is the physical challenge of getting there half the fun? You might revel in the rush of descending a miles-deep chasm or swimming through a flooded cave. The thrill of being the first to see such a sight is its own reward.
	You might instead be a deep delver out of necessity. Perhaps you live in a community located near an entrance to the Underdark that must contend with raids by monsters or savage humanoids, so that patrolling the tunnel and the area around it is essential to your home's survival. Alternatively, your livelihood might depend on searching the Underdark for precious resources, such as rare minerals and magical components, or simply for food. In either case you must become a master of underground tracking and observation to succeed.
	The most well-known deep delvers have patrons who pay them to explore the Underdark. You might be the employee of a wealthy monarch, hired to map an extensive series of passages discovered in one of the realm's mines. Does your patron plan to open up trade with Underdark civilizations, or hope to use the tunnels to launch secret attacks against rivals? The results of your exploration could trigger far-reaching events in the campaign.
	Consider also what you're leaving behind  as you delve. Your connection to family and friends on the surface is cut off during your ventures, but maybe that is the point. Did you become a deep delver to escape something? If so, what better place to hide than the limitless depths of the Underdark?
Born Below
For deep delvers who hail from the Underdark, the subterranean realm isn't a mystery- it's home. What topsiders see as a place of legendary dangers, mythic locales, and otherworldly beasts is just what you deal with every day. If your character is a member of an Underdark race, you probably have little patience with the blundering surface dwellers waving torches in your backyard.
	Consider how your character's home and culture fits into the campaign. Dwarves, renowned for their tremendous underground cities, live in the upper reaches of the realm and regularly deal with surface communities. The same goes for savage humanoids such as goblins or kobolds, though their behavior is far less civil. These races live close enough to the surface that their domains have the feel of a nearby wilderness, much as a human or elf hunter would see a forest or swamp close to home-a place to be taken seriously but lacking mystery.
	Races that dwell deeper, such as the svirfneblin, are one with the Underdark, which provides them with shelter and sustenance. Deep delvers of these races see the world above as a place of wonder and legend, and they view explorers from the surface as sightseeing nuisances.

In the deepest caverns, where the sun is but a myth and the weight of the world crushes all hope, abominations haunt the dark. These perverse beings-aboleths, mind flayers, and worse-exert a loathsome control over the minds of others. Few who become their slaves ever return. Yet some of dauntless resolve do escape, though they are forever burdened by the scars of their slavery. The lingering voice of the master echoes just beyond comprehension in the backs of their minds.
Creating: The aberrant entities that enslave the minds of mortals care little what they prey upon, so escaped thralls can be from any race, class, or culture. Many adopt psionic classes, their liberation having awakened new mental abilities.  When creating an escaped thrall character, you should consider the following story elements.
Monstrous Enslavement
The nature of your captor plays a huge part in how you portray your character's theme. The haunted visions, physical marks, and story elements can vary wildly depending on what creature enslaved you. In a way, your former master is the most important part of your background.
	Whatever the creature that enslaved you, its motives are likely mysterious. The identity of your captor might be a secret that is slowly revealed to you over the course of your dungeon expeditions. Keep in mind that many such monsters are of very high level, so if you want any chance of success, you can't just storm into your captor's lair until you have improved your own capabilities.
Shattered Body
Most thralls bear physical marks of their imprisonment. These might be the lashes made by a drow whip across your back, or scars on your neck from a vampire's bite. These injuries testify to the horrors you endured and might make others feel pangs of pity or revulsion. Do you try to conceal your scars so as not to draw attention to yourself, or do you proudly bear them as proof of your indomitable will?
	Perhaps instead of physical scars, you wear an air of illness. Your skin hangs loose and sickly from malnourishment during your time underground, or dark bags under your eyes reveal that your torment robs you of sleep. Sometimes the signs of your ordeal are subtle, such as the trembling of your hands.
Scarred Mind
Your psychic enslavement has left its mark on your mind. You gained freedom-but at what cost? Do you fear that your master will come for you, or worse, that you might surrender your sanity and return to be enslaved again? Perhaps you cling to ideals or goals to focus your mind, suppressing the memories through force of will. Either way, others might find you enigmatic or even dangerous.
	Even if you have recovered well, your mind has been permanently altered by your captivity. Casting off mental domination has awakened psionic talent in you that had lain dormant until the moment of your freedom. Do you embrace this strange force, or hate it as you hate your former master?

Some things you just don't fight. To take on adversaries that have superior strength, cunning, or resources (or all three), you need to remove their advantages. Such an alternative approach is the job of a trapsmith.
	Humanoids have been building traps since the earliest times, developing techniques to take down big game for food and clothing. According to loremasters, goblin tribes were the first to perfect this kind of hunting. They were able to obtain and store more food than their competition, allowing them to survive harsh winters and increase their numbers. Many years later, other races came to appreciate the ingenuity of their counterparts-mainly through direct interaction with goblin traps.
Creating: Trapsmiths prefer to live in solitude, honing their skills and mastering their trade. You spend your free time researching new and exciting places to go. You might have a core group of friends, but beyond that, you are not very social. Ironically, you might feel like a prisoner in life-with death the ultimate trap to be defeated.
	You might become a trapsmith if you enjoy creating dastardly devices to hinder and harm foes; rogues and possibly rangers are typical classes. You might also choose this theme if you like to play clever tricks or conduct intricate research. A mage or bard makes a good trapsmith. Members of any race might take up such a career, but those with an aptitude for mechanical constructions (such as dwarves, gnomes, or svirfneblin) find greater success, as well as those with some magical aptitude. When creating a trapsmith character, consider the following story elements.
Analytical Mind
You understand physics innately and see life's challenges as equations to be solved, using strict logic to determine the likely success or failure of a course of action. You might not be conscious of this thought process; even in social situations, you tend to analyze the situation coldly instead of considering body language and emotion. Thus, others might think you odd. You prefer to live in solitude, honing your skills and mastering your trade, and you spend your free time researching new and exciting places to go. You might have a core group of friends, but beyond that, you are not very social.
Adrenaline Rush
Nothing is more exciting than disarming a trap that could splatter you across the room. You love getting into the face of death and kicking it hard. You also enjoy the accolades for overcoming dangerous challenges and might purposely seek out bigger and more hazardous traps. The knowledge you win when you survive such dangers lets you make your own creations that much more fiendish. Your creations are feared by all and coveted by those who need to protect something precious.
	Your profession is not a risk-free one. You have suffered for your art and are likely to have scars, welts, or even a missing limb. Rare is the trapsmith who has not had a mishap while setting  disarming a trap. You might also bear emotional scars, which, though not visible, can have longer-lasting effects.

Attaining wealth and glory might be a shallow and selfish goal, but treasure hunters are fine with that. They take on great risk and danger to dig up great riches. Treasure hunters also enjoy the thrill of the chase when seeking out valuable finds, sometimes to the point of addiction, and this adventurous spirit can be contagious.
	Finding lost or buried treasure is much harder than it appears at first. Treasure hunters constantly crave more wealth. They generally learn just enough to find their quarry and care nothing for confirming legends or ancient texts-other than to plunder whatever they refer to. Some, though, learn to love the unique history of the antiquities they seek. Those without a formal education might study a subject related to their quest on their own, even becoming specialists on specific topics.
	Treasure hunters are typically self-sufficient. Occasionally several work together to meet similar goals, but they do not trust each other. Each views the others as brigands and mercenaries out to steal their finds.
Creating: You can apply the treasure hunter theme to any character concept that thrives on risk-taking and exploration (even more so than the average adventurer). You might enjoy this theme if you wish to play a cunning character who enjoys overcoming difficult challenges through unconventional thinking. When creating your treasure hunter character, keep these story elements in mind.
Adroit Dungeoneer
You are a skilled adventurer, able to adapt to any situation. Although your yearning for wealth and recognition drives you, you have earned a reputation for cleverness. You enjoy finding solutions to problems and applying your unique logic when dealing with unusual situations.
	Throughout your career as a treasure hunter, you have had to deal with threats that are common in dungeons. Although each dungeon is unique, all share some features. You know these by heart and know how to handle each of them.
	Your reputation speaks volumes about your sense of adventure and your proven experience. Employers love your attitude and are confident in your success at acquiring an relic or treasure.
Recognized Expert
Many of the world's famous treasure hunters are renowned for their expertise in recovering specific types of treasure and overcoming the threats that guard them from plunderers. You make sure to be as informed as possible about the places where you will be adventuring.
	Another reason to specialize is simply a matter of business. Your choice is based on a given treasure's value, availability, and salability. You might be inclined to let the small fish fight over the latest fad while you bring back more lucrative pieces. On the other hand, you might join the crowd, knowing you are much more likely than the rest to get the goods.
Living on the Edge
You are a thrill-seeker, constantly on the lookout for adventures that will sate your hunger for danger. Riches and fame aren't enough-you love living by the seat of your pants. You feel most alive whenever you get into a precarious situation and manage to avert the danger, all while showing off your skills.
	Not many can boast of a life as exciting as what you have experienced, and you have no intention of slowing down now. To you, life is a one big treasure hunt, and the ultimate prize is a sense of accomplishment mixed with plenty of thrills. You will look back when you are old and say to yourself, “Whoa! I lived an amazing life!”

The Underdark is a dangerous place, and not just for the horrors that lurk in the darkness. The cities and enclaves that dot its murky caverns are hotbeds of spite and political intrigue. To survive for long in such societies, you have to know how to play the game. Physical prowess is no match for the wits of a skilled diplomat.
	The great city-states of the Underdark were first established as collections of tribes with a shared need for survival. As the centuries rolled by, these settlements developed into self-sufficient communities and grew into nations. Their growth was aided by individuals who could seek out and interact with the other city-states to establish lines of communication. These representatives grew experienced at dealing with the different Underdark races and became expert diplomats and negotiators.
Creating: You might become an Underdark envoy if you delight in political intrigue, spying, and social maneuvering. Many successful political leaders were once envoys, whether due to merit and ability, or because they were able to orchestrate the removal of their predecessors.
	Bards and rogues are natural class choices for this career path, as well as any character who has diplomatic talent, including clerics and warlords. Beings of a gruff or  introverted nature, such as dwarves, rarely become envoys. The drow have mastered the skill of diplomacy over centuries of cutthroat politics, and they have the most capable and dominant envoys in the Underdark. Consider the following story elements when creating your Underdark envoy character.
Dark Delegate
You are an extension of your master's will, an instrument to further his or her interests. On returning from a mission, you are expected to relay not only the response of the other party, but also its tone and attitude. The more information you convey to your employer, the greater advantage he or she will enjoy in political power plays and future exchanges. If you are a freelance envoy, not bound to one employer, you seek to make a name for yourself as a neutral third party. In this capacity you manage labor disputes, conduct trade negotiations, and perform similar tasks, commanding a high wage for your services.
	Yours is a precarious path. You not only deliver communications from your masters, but you also glean whatever information you can while on the job. Anything might give you a crucial advantage in future employment. Thus, you have to be very clever and perceptive, while at the same time appearing inoffensive. This sort of agent works against expectations and can include dwarves, duergar, or svirfneblin.
Double Agent
A few Underdark envoys serve as double agents for a faction, generally to facilitate the collapse of a powerful political entity. Such people are rare, for the role is exceedingly dangerous, If you became a double agent, you likely received an offer to betray an employer after delivering a message on his or her behalf-along with a suitable financial incentive to secure such services.
	As a double agent, you remain under cover much of the time while you work on behalf of another entity. You maintain your status within your ostensible employer's organization while feeding vital information to the other side, revealing yourself only if your activities are found out. In this role, you must be extremely skilled in both providing misinformation to your target and locating other agents who might have infiltrated the organization. You carefully collect information on everything that has been said and done to support your complex web of political scheming. Should you fail, you're likely to end up dead in some dark alleyway or Underdark corridor. Why do you take such risks? Was your choice personal, to take revenge on a cruel master, or did you do it just for the money?
Mercantile Advantage
Not all Underdark envoys are spies or political plotters. You might use your skills to expand your own wealth and that of others by negotiating merchant treaties between powerful cities. Influential members of Underdark communities employ individuals such as yourself to help increase their economic power while protecting their political interests. Sometimes you manipulate markets to help your employer gain a monetary advantage over rivals.
	Envoys of this sort can come from any Underdark race, and they might even include topsiders who are trusted in their dealings with those below. You could be a former explorer who decided to turn your talents to more profitable interests while still keeping your hand in the adventuring business.

A lone figure, haggard and lean, scrambles through the tunnel as he peers fearfully over his shoulder. He bears marks of shame-scars from lashes and manacles, bruises, brands. Behind lies his home, from which he has been exiled forever. A pained look crosses his face before it is replaced by a determined grimace. The Underdark is not kind to the weak.
	Underdark outcasts did not start out as subterranean vagabonds. Some were proud members of their underground society, exemplars of their race's customs or beliefs. They might have been dwarf artisans in the service of a king, or tribal warriors amid chanting goblin hordes. Something happened to disrupt their existence and drive them from their communities. Perhaps they committed a crime or dishonored the family name, or became disgusted by their people's ways. Whatever the reason, they have been cast into the depths to live or die as fate wills.
	Underdark outcasts wander far from the place of their disgrace in search of a new life. Usually hated by members of their own society, they must rely on their own wits or the kindness of strangers to survive. Most remain underground out of habit, it being their birthplace, but others deliberately venture to surface realms-though they rarely find refuge there.
Creating: Underdark outcasts come from races dwelling underground, such as dwarves, goblins, or svirfneblin. Many belong to folk who get a hostile reception from surface dwellers. They might be of any class or alignment, united only in their common disgrace. Your unique background inspires your personality, class, feat, and power selection. When creating an
Underdark outcast, consider the following story elements.
Disgraced Exile
Behind every Underdark outcast is a story, though it never ends well. You are defined by the circumstances that led to your banishment. The nature of your transgression varies wildly depending on your race and culture. Dwarves, with their emphasis on duty to the clan and personal honor, expel those who fail to live up to their responsibilities-a traumatic experience for any dwarf. Monstrous races, such as kobolds or orcs, are more likely to cast out one of their own because of a petty or violent disagreement, with the outcast the loser. The nature of your disgrace affects the way you interact with others in a group, especially if members of your race are among them.
	What were the events of your exile? Were you a petty criminal, punished for your crimes? Did you break a dire social taboo, robbing you not only of home but of your dignity as well? Perhaps you betrayed someone important or failed to honor an agreement. Whatever your crime, why were you exiled rather than punished some other way?
	The consequences of your banishment matter as well. Maybe you had to leave behind a promising life or something of importance, such as an estate or family. Consider also how your exile has changed you. Are you filled with bitterness and hate, plotting revenge against those who hurt you? Did you go as far away as possible and never look back? Maybe you were falsely judged or made a mistake you regret. Your circumstances might motivate you to undertake a quest to clear your name or undo a wrong.
Outcast by Choice
Some Underdark outcasts leave their homes willingly. Such a choice is most common among evil Underdark societies, such as those of drow or kobolds. Once in a great while, circumstances can force one of their number to rise above the rest. Striking out into the deep caverns alone took uncommon courage, but you were driven by your convictions.
	As a youngster, did you realize that there was something different about you? Perhaps your peers fought and cursed at each other while you were busy thinking. You might have been something of a social revolutionary, trying to drag your incorrigible folk out of their petty ways. How were your efforts viewed by your kind? Did some of these ideas start to catch on, challenging your chief 's rule? You might have had no choice but to ostracize yourself; perhaps you are being hunted through the tunnels around your home.

Mariners are intrepid folk who take to the world's great oceans and seas, living on the rolling waves aboard ships of all kinds. Though they hail from many races and walks of life, mariners have one thing that unites them-a love of the sea and the freedom it brings. Mariners set their course for wherever the winds take them, whether dodging icebergs in the arctic circle, clipping through the azure waters of the tropics, or crossing vast seas to unknown lands. The crisp sea air is the siren that turns the mariner's rudder to dry land, drawing him or her to see what's beyond the watery horizons.
	No two mariners share the same story. Their backgrounds converge only in the fact that they have made a life for themselves aboard a ship. For most, this will have been a decision made by choice. Many find ample opportunities to seek wealth by traveling from port to port to trade goods from distant nations. Experienced mariners sometimes seek rich patrons willing to finance daring voyages. Plotting courses to new lands-and claiming them in the name of their patron-can bring wealth and fame to the mariner. Others might have dedicated their lives to the royal navy, waging war against the realm's enemies by sea. These naval captains are the stuff of legends. Few mariners reach such lofty status, yet even the rank-and-file who crew the ships are rewarded with more adventure and gold than they would ever gain while on land.
	Although many raise sail for love of adventure or as a profession, those who spend most of their lives on ships have darker experiences. These folk are the dread pirates who plunder the coasts. For these individuals, the sea might serve as a refuge from the hangman's noose, but most pirates adopt their ways after realizing that the expansive holds of merchant fleets contain enough wealth for a hundred lifetimes. Fighting, drinking, and the feel of gold spilling through fingers are pleasures enough to draw even honest mariners to live the pirate's life.
	The importance that great bodies of water play in various cultures means that members of many races become mariners. Though the great fleets of humanity can dominate the trade lanes, flotillas of halfling skiffs ride the rivers far inland. The graceful prows of eladrin ships glide through the shimmering waters of the Feywild. Underground, dwarven barges cruise through subterranean rivers. Still other mariners are independent members of a tribe, paddling swift canoes or catamarans from island to island.
	Whether one is a humble sailor, a dashing captain, or a cutthroat pirate, all mariners share a love of freedom. Riding the winds gives them independence unknown by the masses on dry land. The open sea, fleet winds, the song of gulls, and the promise of adventure pull mariners more strongly than the ebbing tide.
Creating:
Members of any class could enjoy a life as a mariner. Rogues and rangers excel as mariners due to their diverse skills and maneuverability. Fighters, paladins, and warlords might be mariners aboard a vessel, where they adapt their fighting styles to the close quarters of ship-to-ship warfare. Scholarly characters can draw on their studies to help navigate treacherous waters or communicate with newly encountered civilizations, while ritual-using mariners could conjure winds or sea creatures. Primal characters are sometimes drawn by water spirits to the ocean. Regardless of class, mariners develop similar talents learned from a life at sea, which makes them versatile and responsive to the changing winds of fate.

Lolth demands that the strong survive to rule the weak, and every drow house follows this most sacred of commandments. If you fall to a rival's machinations, then you did not deserve your position in the first place.
	You were born to rule. As the daughter of a matron mother, you claimed the divine power of Lolth as your birthright, and with it you mean to advance your station and secure your destiny. You spent fifty years in training at Arach-Tinilith, but the endless cycle of ritual was not for you. You prefer the chaotic arena of your own house, battling your sisters for dominance. You excel at betrayal and don't hesitate to turn against enemies and allies alike.
	One day, you will succeed your matron mother-most likely by the edge of a sacrificial blade. Until then, you lurk and scheme, weaving a web of intrigue.

Creating:
A house priestess treats her station as a political office foremost; she might be devoted to Lolth, but that fact is independent of her status. She is always a female drow and is usually noble. Perhaps she is a daughter of the matron mother, an adoptee from another house, or a promoted commoner. Noble drow daughters who hope to advance within the house hierarchy must demonstrate some level of divine talent, even if they are more warrior, wizard, or rogue than cleric.

Requirements: 
You must be a female drow from any divine class.

Lolth governs all aspects of drow life, teaching the art of destruction and the beauty of chaos. All things feed the insatiable hunger of the Spider Queen, but she best rewards those servants who deliver the tastiest sweetmeats of misery and darkness. Such worshipers eschew the decadence of drow society in favor of the simpler, harsher ways of the spider. They retreat to the halls of Arach-Tinilith, swearing themselves entirely to Lolth in a dark sisterhood.
	From the time you were born, the Spider Queen held you in special favor, granting you great facility with divine magic. Perhaps she foresaw in you remarkable strength, wickedness, or cunning. Whatever the reason, Lolth marked your birth by sending a demonic spider to your side, and it has been your constant companion ever since. You share a natural hunger to feast upon those weaker than yourselves.
	As a girl, you found refuge within Arach-Tinilith, away from the petty scheming and political ambitions of your sisters. In its comforting embrace, you devoted all your time to serving the Spider Queen in the best way you knew. After many decades of study, you have come to understand the depths of Lolth's chaotic hedonism in a way few others can, and you are confident in your superiority.
	Now that you clearly see the underpinnings of drow society, you know that Menzoberranzan stands upon a fragile precipice. You endeavor to serve-and feed-the Spider Queen, but you must maintain the balance of treachery lest the city fall, to the detriment of the goddess and her worshipers. You have sworn to defend your home against threats from within and without.

Creating:
A widow of Arach-Tinilith must be a female drow sworn to Lolth. Her service to the goddess comes before anything else, and the day-to-day political maneuvering of Menzoberranzan means nothing to her. Such dedicated priestesses of the Spider Queen form a tight clique, and they are intolerant of those without divine abilities or backgrounds.

You must be a female drow from any divine class.

Menzoberranzan is built on unwritten laws that provide some semblance of structure to the chaotic lives of the drow. Its harsh society does not tolerate nonconformity. Those who stand up to the matriarchy or who blaspheme against Lolth have no allies. Such drow are expelled by their houses-if they are not killed out of hand. Usually, those so exiled do not long survive, but there is a refuge for such misfits: Bregan D'aerthe. The infamous mercenary company takes in drow of all stripes: commoners who have run afoul of the priestesses, exiles, and the children of destroyed houses.
	You are one such unfortunate: you were cast out of Menzoberranzan society for crimes real or perceived. When you joined, you abandoned your past, your heritage, and even your name, and you were expressly forbidden to talk about them. A sellsword, you fight for masters who in turn offer their services to the highest bidder. Bregan D'aerthe takes care of its own, though, and you can count on your new allies to protect you from past reprisals—as long as you remain useful.
	As it is with the Bregan D'aerthe spy (see the Neverwinter Campaign Setting), the deadly mercenary group to which you owe your loyalty might occasionally place demands on your time or efforts. Unlike those far-roving agents, some of whom operate on the surface, you stick to more localized bloodshed. You also lack the specialization of such spies, being as likely to have a martial background as an arcane one; you might even be a cleric of a deity other than Lolth. You are a mystery: cold steel wrapped in a silken sheath.

Creating:
Members of Bregan D'aerthe can be of any skill set. Anyone who proves worthy or useful is a candidate for recruitment, though most members are exiled drow. Under unusual circumstances, Bregan D'aerthe even takes in those who are not drow if they are valuable.
Most members of Bregan D'aerthe are male, and the priestesses of Menzoberranzan despise it for sheltering those who escape their power. The organization does forge alliances with female drow, however, and occasionally it takes in female members.

Some drow males rebel overtly against their subservient roles, while others find subtler means to confound the expectations of an order that seeks to grind them down. Elderboys embody such contradiction: males who are favored within their houses. They play by the matriarchy's rules-at least when others are looking.
	Your birth was the first time you disappointed your matron mother, and since then your life only went downhill. You learned from an early age that you are inferior in every way. Paradoxically, what you also learned-and the reason you still live-is how to derive power by apparently submitting.
	Perhaps you had the good fortune to be born the first male child of your matron mother, or a series of unfortunate occurrences claimed your older brothers. You might even have been the third son, born to be sacrificed to Lolth, but one of your brothers perished first, incidentally raising your status. You quickly climbed to the vaunted position of elderboy, the matron's oldest living son, earning something like honor within your house.
	Your actions reflect not only on you but on your house, and it is your responsibility to rise above your mother's limited expectations. Your station is the envy of the other males, and you must defend yourself with all your treacherous wit.

Creating:
An elderboy is, of course, a male drow. He can be of any class but is expected to master his chosen profession and thereby win respect. (His path might also depend on his house, since different drow families focus on particular areas; consult your DM.)
Most elderboys are warriors, since males pursuing a martial path are seen as the least threatening by house females. Such a privileged male with an arcane background faces added scrutiny from house females, who consider him too powerful for his own good; conversely, an elderboy of subtle skills (such as those of a rogue) faces continual challenges from younger brothers and other males who believe him to be weak.

Requirements: 
You must be a male drow.

You are a warrior born and bred. The pounding of blood in your veins, the thrill of battle, the knife edge between life and death-all these things are precious to you. You call yourself a champion; though the title might weigh heavy at the beginning of your career, your chosen destiny is to seize that honor. You will not rest until you are the undisputed master of warfare as only drow can conduct it: with skill, flair, and deceit.
	You chose a martial path to escape from your lowly birth, hoping to follow a road to higher station and greater power. Your training has toughened you against the rigors of drow society and, as your career progresses, you demand respect at the edge of your blades. You have performed well in the Grand Melee-a test of strategy, cunning, and skill-besting most if not all your rivals. You long for the day when you will triumph over all the other students.
	At the academy, you also found a kind of nobility you had never encountered in your youth. Grace and beauty live in battle and in the wary camaraderie that warriors develop. In the company of other males, your gender meant little; you were allowed a certain degree of self-determination. Your skills have even earned something like respect from the few female students and instructors at Melee-Magthere.
	What will you do after leaving the school? You owe your training to the orders of your odious matron mother, but you feel no sense of loyalty to her. Just as your house uses you to earn esteem-hoping to boast of an infamous warrior or weapon master-so should you in turn exploit that relationship to earn glory and advance your own ends.

Creating:
Melee-Magthere is the school of Tier Breche devoted to martial pursuits, so the skills it teaches are most appropriate to a martial defender or striker. All noble drow are expected to take instruction at Melee-Magthere, regardless of their inclinations, but most of those who excel are warriors or rogues.
Although most long-time students of Melee-Magthere are male, some female drow also prove skilled and worthy of glory. Such a career is considered beneath females, but those who lack arcane aptitude or the favor of Lolth have little choice.

Requirements: 
You must be a drow and any martial class or defender role.

Sorcere represents the most powerful bastion of male power in Menzoberranzan. Although the school owes ostensible fealty to the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith, Sorcere offers its pupils the chance to study as they wish, with only lax oversight from the matriarchs of drow society.
	Your enrollment in Sorcere was a great relief after having lived with the cruel oppression of your matron mother and sisters. Here you could pursue your interests while paying only lip service to Lolth and her minions. You bow and scrape but hide a smile behind your hand, because one day you might use the powers you gain at Sorcere for a direct assault against the matriarchy.
	Until then, you exploit your limited autonomy to quietly increase your personal power. You care little for social machinations and the small-minded pursuit of face, though you are not stupid enough to ignore such games. You are drow, after all, and Sorcere has plenty of intrigues of its own.

Creating:
Most noble drow spend some time studying at Sorcere, but those who excel are usually male wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks.
Female drow usually take basic studies at Sorcere before moving on to the more socially acceptable service of Lolth. A few females' talents run more to arcane magic than the divine, however.

Few drow are mad enough to forsake the ways of Lolth for Ghaunadaur, the elder evil that rules over the disgusting filth of the world. Those who do might become lords of the slime-covered caverns of the Underdark, and command oozes, jellies, puddings, and other aberrations to do their bidding. An ooze master regularly forsakes the comforts of traditional drow society to venture into the cold, wet, dark, and abandoned places of the earth. There, an acolyte of That Which Lurks can study the slimes of the Underdark, with only Ghaunadaur's insane whispers to keep him or her company. When an ooze master walks the halls of drow cities and settlements, he or she strives to keep a low profile, because strange mannerisms and a fascination with aberrant creatures serve only to draw unwanted attention.
	An ooze master must fight constantly against whispers of madness that seek to consume the mind. Ghaunadaur desires only to devour the world, and Ghaunadaur's worshipers claim to hear his voice inside their heads, urging them down a path of destruction. With arcane power gifted by the ancient god, an ooze master calls forth corrosive goo to scar and maim opponents. An adherent that is lucky enough to retain some semblance of sanity normally exhibits only a few symptoms of Ghaunadaur's madness, but an episode of full-blown insanity can still strike at a moment's notice.
	Worship of Ghaunadaur is forbidden in Menzoberranzan. Even the maddest of acolytes knows better than to invoke foul magic in the presence of Lolth's servants. Traveling with an ooze master is dangerous; many of the Spider Queen's agents have been trained to recognize the telltale signs of insanity.

Creating:
Most ooze masters are wizards, psions, invokers, clerics, or others who have a bookish nature, a strong mind, and a penchant for magical study. An ooze master is usually a disaffected drow, forced to hide dark urges from the bulk of drow society. Sometimes, however, Ghaunadaur seduces humans, tieflings, and members of other races with whispered promises of power.

Some Menzoberranzan drow yearn for a life free from the tyranny of the Spider Queen. These apostate drow have renounced the teachings of Lolth and embraced a philosophy based on individuality and free will. Existence for these secret apostates is dangerous, because they live in constant fear of discovery by Lolth's many spies. If their true nature is discovered, they face certain torture and death.
	A secret apostate values freedom and choice, and each pursues personal goals independent of those dictated by other members of drow society or its dark mistress. By no stretch of the imagination does this imply most secret apostates are noble or good; they remain just as selfish and avaricious as other drow. They believe that their aspirations and desires trump those of an overbearing and controlling theocracy.
	After renouncing Lolth, a secret apostate usually travels one of two paths. Some develop such a strong hatred for their own society that they actively work to undermine and destroy it. Specializing in elaborate schemes and intrigues, such an apostate might foment a slave rebellion or create conflict between two houses by assassinating a high-ranking official of one house and framing the other for the deed.
	Other secret apostates become loners, seeking to avoid others of their kind and to forge their own destinies. One might travel to the surface world, only to wander through foreign lands inhabited by those who distrust or wish to destroy the drow.
	Regardless of the path taken, a secret apostate loathes other drow as much as any surface-dweller and does not hesitate to kill members of his or her race if the occasion demands it.
	For those who follow the arduous and lonely road of the secret apostate, it is better to risk torture and death as a free drow than to endure an existence of servitude. Let the weak-willed sheep bind themselves to the Spider Queen. A secret apostate lives a life unfettered, or dies trying.

Creating:
Secret apostates hide in every corner of drow society, linked only by their renunciation of Lolth. Most have some weapon training: fighters, warlords, and rogues slightly outnumber bards, swordmages, and warlocks. Few secret apostates worship gods, so divine classes are rare, but those who do worship a deity favor the gods of the surface-dwellers.

Requirements: 
Drow. All secret apostates are drow who have turned against Lolth.

The power of the priestesses of Lolth in Menzoberranzan is almost absolute, but some residents worship the patron god of male drow, Vhaeraun. Primarily spies, assassins, and thieves, adherents of Vhaeraun slip stealthily through the shadows of the city on missions for the Masked God of Night. Open worship of Vhaeraun is forbidden, so his followers must conceal their allegiance. Many cannot endure the constant fear of capture and flee to the surface world.
	Almost all skulkers of Vhaeraun are disenfranchised male drow who are disappointed by their lack of authority and power in Menzoberranzan's matriarchal society. Although some have renounced the evil ways of their people, many Vhaeraun worshipers remain true to drow nature, and they readily lie, steal, and betray if it serves their needs.
	A skulker of Vhaeraun excels at getting into and out of hostile areas unnoticed. Consider an assassin who infiltrates a noble manse to slay its occupants with poisonous blades. Imagine a thief slipping into a temple of Lolth to steal a priceless treasure or cutting a dangling purse from an easy mark in a city street. Picture an accomplished spy, who might pose as a consort to a loyal priestess to glean information from her, or who might accept employ in a rival house's guard to overhear secrets. Each of these individuals might worship the Masked Lord.
	Poison is the favored weapon of Vhaeraun's servants. A skulker excels in its use, coating his blades and arrows with drow sleep poison or other exotic poisons such as black lotus extract or spotted toadstool venom. The Masked Lord's followers delight in discovering new poisons and pay handsomely to acquire them.

Creating:
Most of Vhaeraun's faithful are surface-dwelling drow. Many skulkers are rogues and assassins, although bards and warlocks might also serve as spies for the Masked God of Night. Divine practitioners are also common. The vast majority of those who serve Vhaeraun are male drow, but a few females also revere him.

Society of Sensation members are referred to as Sensates and often are stereotyped as hedonists, pleasure-seekers, and layabouts. For some members, these characterizations are true. More dedicated Sensates understand that the only way to truly experience life is to seek out variety in all things. Although tasting exotic food and drink is important, it's just as important to understand what it's like to go without even basic sustenance to experience the feeling of deprivation.
	Sensates seek this balance. The faction teaches that the only way to discover the purpose of the multiverse is to experience as many sensations, colors, textures, impulses, feelings, smells, and sensory inputs as possible. Only when every possible moment is experienced will the truth become clear; a composite understanding of existence will crystallize to those who have sought out and processed it all.
	A lofty goal, for sure, which is why the Society believes that no one has managed it yet. Still, it's hard to argue with the benefits of seeking out new experiences, especially for adventurers and explorers. The Society of Sensation teaches how to turn those experiences toward meaningful use.

Creating:
The Society of Sensation embraces beings from all walks of life, of any race, class, or alignment. Each member brings different experiences to be shared with the Society, and their diversity provides a plethora of different backgrounds to draw upon.
The sharing of sensations and experiences is not just a metaphor: To join the faction, would-be members must place five experiences from their memories into a "recorder stone," each focusing on one of the five senses. If the offered sensations contribute something to the Society that no current member has experienced, the applicant joins the faction. Otherwise, he or she must explore the multiverse further to gain a unique experience before trying again.

There is a rhythm to the planes that few can hear. It is all around, permeating every living being, every piece of land and sea, and every act of magic. Yet it often goes muffled and ignored, drowned out by the sound of your thoughts. Only by knowing yourself and unifying thought and action can you exist in harmony with everything.
	The Transcendent Order teaches that the path to enlightenment comes from knowing your body and learning to listen to what existence is telling you to do instead of what your mind is saying.
	This quality gives the Order's members the reputation for being impulsive, yet they also can be stoic and introspective. This dichotomy, in addition to the fact that they seek all their answers from within, leads others to call them Ciphers, since they can be indecipherable to those not listening in the right place.
	The Transcendent Order teaches that action without thought is the most perfect form of action, since that action is taken in harmony with the multiverse. This philosophy does not mean that a Cipher charges in blindly whenever an opportunity arises; it means that he or she attempts to transcend the moment and touch a higher purpose.

Creating:
Ciphers gravitate away from the extremes of alignment, since moral codes of all kinds imply a measure of analysis. Thus, most Ciphers are unaligned, preferring to worry about their own enlightenment more than the struggles of others.
Training the body and mind to work in perfect harmony appeals most strongly to members of martial classes such as fighters and rogues. The higher level of consciousness that Ciphers strive for also appeals strongly to psionic characters, especially monks. Spellcasting classes sometimes have difficulty combining their studied methods with the Cipher philosophy, though those who do can be highly dangerous adversaries.

Patterns. Rules. Order. These are tools of the dim and the ignorant use to attempt to codify the multiverse and understand it. Instead, Xaositects (also known as the Chaosmen) believe that the answer is staring everyone in the face: There are no rules, and there is no deeper meaning to existence. Attempting to impose any kind of structure is antithetical to what it all means, and trying to stem the tide of change and disorder puts you farther away from understanding it all and finding your place in the chaotic sea of reality.
	If this view is true, does that mean that all reality is meaningless, and everyone should sink into despair? Yes and no. (Or no and yes.) Other factions might wallow in doom and gloom over this perceived futility, but the Xaositects' understanding goes deeper than that. Down into despair is certainly one direction, but a body who embraces chaos is equally likely to float up into happiness, or sideways into the street. Reality is meaningless, but a lack of meaning isn't a bad thing in and of itself. Abandoning a search for meaning is the surest way to find it. The more your life reflects chaos, the more your life is like the multiverse, and both are sources of endless surprise.

Creating:
Chaos is all around you and in you, and never mind those clueless sods who try to ignore the fact. Your purpose in life is to keep everything changing. Whether you bathed in the elemental energies of a chaotic plane or just hit your head too hard, the call of chaos is irresistible.
The Xaositect faction accepts anyone. Excluding a specific race or class would mean making a rule about that prohibition, and creating rules creates a clear contradiction. Sorcerers who follow the path of the wild mage are the most common class-if anything could be said to be common among this diverse and changeable group.

When a person commits an act of brutal violence without the use of a weapon other than one's bare hands, the dark powers might consign the perpetrator to live afterward as one of the misshapen. The offender could be a thief who strangles his partner so he can keep treasure for himself, or a bounty hunter who holds his prey underwater until it drowns, or a jealous sibling who pushes his brother off a cliff, or a corrupt magistrate who tosses exculpatory evidence into the flames. Anyone who acts in such a way risks being noticed and cursed by the dark powers. When the powers decide to take notice, the individual is surrounded suddenly by the mists and experiences a gruesome transformation. The limb that carried out the foul deed becomes monstrously twisted and malformed. These unfortunates make up the ranks of the misshapen, and each must endure a continuing existence of solitude and suffering.
	Most misshapen keep to themselves and hide their deformed limbs beneath their cloaks. (The afflicted appendage is almost always an arm or some other extremity used for gripping and manipulation, even if the limb that committed the evil deed was not actually of that sort.) Although a misshapen's mutated limb might be viewed by many (including that individual) as a horrible detriment, it does provide some benefit to the character, who gains extraordinary abilities from the altered appendage.
	Despite the potential usefulness of these transformations they suffer, misshapen tend to avoid the villages and settlements of Ravenloft. When they travel through civilized areas, misshapen often meet suspicion and fear, because the common folk lack compassion or tolerance for things they cannot understand. Many a tale has been told of villagers chasing a monster from their midst, and in some of those cases the creature might not have been a true monster at all. As such, most misshapen would rather not risk capture or death at the hands of an angry mob. Occasionally, however, such a character does encounter kindness from strangers, and some societies might even welcome a misshapen into their midst.
	Most often, the curse of the dark powers alters one of the misshapen's limbs to resemble that of an animal or monster, such as an ogre's fist or a tiger's paw. Over time, the curse might worsen or spread. The behavior of the affected limb could become unpredictable. It might occasionally act of its own accord, without its owner's consent, suddenly snaking out to grab a victim by the throat, or striking a creature that has angered or irritated the misshapen. In such cases, the offending limb responds to the emotional state of the misshapen and acts on his or her subconscious impulses. A misshapen beset with this kind of affliction must take special care to control or suppress angry reactions, lest the altered appendage suddenly come to life.
	Some misshapen seek only to rid themselves of this curse, and will go to any lengths to obtain knowledge that might aid them in eliminating their condition. Other misshapen view their affliction as a blessing from the dark powers and see themselves as an evolutionary improvement over their unaltered companions.

Creating:
Misshapen come from all walks of life, for no one is immune to the curse of the dark powers. Those with a wild, primitive nature, such as barbarians and fighters, seem particularly susceptible to the affliction. The curse also frequently strikes shifters, lycanthropes, and wilden, although members of any other race can be transformed if they commit an act of savage violence.

When a mortal commits a cold, calculated act of violence with a sword, an axe, or some other weapon, he risks being cursed by the dark powers to a life of fear and suffering. Perhaps the warrior put an entire village to the sword in an effort to capture and kill one escaped criminal. Perhaps he desecrated a holy temple, shattering sacred relics with a great warhammer. Or perhaps he betrayed and executed an innocent friend with a headsman's axe. From such unspeakable deeds are born the haunted blades, warriors doomed to carry the terror of their victims with them for the rest of their days.
	Even though some haunted blades commit their crimes in the name of a noble cause, they, like all of their number, have been singled out by the dark powers for a unique gift. The violent deed leaves the haunted blade forever changed. Henceforth, when such a warrior draws his weapon, his countenance takes on the appearance of a creature infused with dark power, and he becomes terrifying to behold. The sins from his past resonate with a haunted blade when he ventures into battle, and the fear and horror his innocent victims once felt emanates from him in waves of sheer terror. For a brief moment, the haunted blade is able to share with his enemies the deep fear he endures every day.
	Whether a haunted blade has been chosen by the dark powers is open for debate. Some scholars posit that spirits of ancient magic weapons roam the domains of dread, and these spirits are drawn to acts of darkness like moths to a flame. Under this theory, the dark spirit gains access to the haunted blade's mind, lurking in the deep recesses of his brain. Although the spirit is unable to take control of its mortal host, when the haunted blade draws his weapon, the ancient spirit surges into it. The drawn weapon often becomes encased in shadow, and ebon tendrils snake forth from its surface, hungering for blood. Regardless of whether a haunted blade has been touched by the dark powers or invaded by a shadowy spirit of an ancient weapon (or perhaps both), the force inside the warrior will attempt to steer him down the path to evil.
	Haunted blades often depend on their companions for support in their dark and treacherous journey. Many such characters are truly repentant, and seek out allies of good moral codes to help them make up for their past mistakes. Sometimes the darkness inside a haunted blade bubbles to the surface, however, and one might commit an act that its allies find troublesome. Such an act might be murdering a creature that has surrendered in battle, torturing a prisoner for information, erupting in sudden violence while in the peaceful confines of a city, or turning on a trusted ally.
	A haunted blade often hears the whispers of the dark force inside him, urging him toward acts of betrayal, but this path is by no means an inevitable one. If you're interested in using this theme, talk to your DM and the other players to ensure that a character who might suddenly turn on his allies (which is entirely the player's decision; this theme does not mandate such an occurrence) is something the group finds fun to roleplay and an acceptable addition to the party.
	Haunted blades carry within themselves the seeds of what it means to be a dark lord. At some point each one must choose which direction his or her life will take. Will a haunted blade continue the descent into darkness, winning more favor from the dark powers until finally becoming a dark lord? Or will he instead choose the path of virtue, trusting in his companions to show him the way back to the light? Until that day of redemption comes, when a haunted blade strides into battle with weapon drawn, his enemies will cower before him. They know instinctively that this darkness is not to be trifled with; it is a force of pure dread in a world already filled with horror.

Creating:
Usually those who become haunted blades already have a strong, forceful personality. Warlords, paladins, and ardents are especially common among characters who have this theme; bards and warlocks who favor melee weapons also often become haunted blades. Regardless of race or class, haunted blades carry a darkness inside them and a capacity for evil that they must constantly strive to keep in check.

Beguilers aspire to become masters of deception in all its forms. Consummate practical jokers, they delight in playing tricks even on their closest friends. A beguiler might be a master spy, able to slip into the shadows of an alley to evade a bothersome patrol, or a glib-tongued charmer who cons a wealthy merchant out of priceless jewels. Unattended valuables have a way of mysteriously disappearing in a beguiler's presence; those that are carefully watched are simply more of a challenge.
	Beguilers struggle to tell the truth at the best of times. The stories they recount feature outlandish embellishments: The small drake vanquished by the beguiler's adventuring party is likely to become a massive red dragon somewhere around the third retelling. Succeeding with one lie just encourages the beguiler to try another, more outrageous one.
	The greater the level of skill required to pull off a deception, the more likely a beguiler is to attempt it, just to see what he or she can get away with. Should a patron challenge one to pull off a difficult heist, or to deceive an entire town with a near-impossible illusion, the beguiler will pursue the assignment obsessively, to the exclusion of all else.
	Beguilers often find employment as spies or thieves. Most possess a smattering of skills useful to such occupations: the crafting of disguises, the ability to disarm traps and pick troublesome locks, and the training to tread quietly without drawing attention. Able to think quickly on their feet, beguilers can lie readily and convincingly should they be discovered in an indelicate situation. Unlike most traditional spies, however, many beguilers also possess a strong affinity for mind-altering magic (including bards, or wizards specializing in illusion or enchantment) or a strong connection to the Shadowfell (such as assassins and nethermancers). Whether conjuring an illusory wall of fog to secure their escape, or implanting a simple magical suggestion in a guard, beguilers frequently use arcane trickery to succeed in their goals.
	Most covert operators aim to get away clean and finish the task with none the wiser. Beguilers, however, take great pride in their grandiose deceptions and want the world to know what they have accomplished- not just that they succeeded, but how they did it. Thus, a beguiler might leave a calling card after stealing an enchanted sword from a supposedly impregnable vault, or imprint a unique signature on a masterful illusion, such as a fake volcanic eruption that evacuates a nearby town.
	Beguilers place great importance on their reputations, and many acquire followers who admire their exploits. They delight in building an entourage that hangs on their every word. As they rise in stature, beguilers seek to acquire apprentices from the ranks of amateur thieves and illusionists drawn to their growing legend-though such a master never reveals all his or her secrets. Ironically for those so adept at deceiving others, beguilers are often vulnerable to flattery from sycophantic devotees.

Creating:
Anyone with a penchant for illusion or trickery can become a beguiler. Members of stealthy classes such as rogues, assassins, vampires, and monks sometimes follow this path, as do those more versed in arcane magic, such as wizards (illusionists, enchanters, nethermancers), warlocks, and bards. Halflings, gnomes, and humans are most commonly beguilers, but members of all races can be drawn to the art of deception.

Occultists believe the cosmos is trying to tell them something. They see signs everywhere-in the arrangement of leaves upon a pond, the flight of birds, or the positions of the constellations in the night sky-and work diligently to decipher their meaning. Many occultists also dabble in numerology, seeing mathematics as but one of the languages by which the enigmatic forces of creation seek to communicate. Every crypt explored, every ritual mastered, every ancient text translated leads an occultist closer to unlocking the mysteries of the multiverse.
	Highly sought after for their ability to divine meaning from even the most mundane objects, occultists might advise powerful individuals or even whole settlements. Some serve as royal astrologers and foretell the consequences of future actions from the patterns of the stars. Others are village augurs, determining the outcome of the harvest by examining the entrails of sacrificial animals. A few set up shop as fortune-tellers, reading tea leaves or prophesying through the use of cards or crystal balls. Many occultists do not possess genuine powers of foresight but rely instead on observation and shrewd deduction to do "cold reading" on their subjects. Some do master and perform divination rituals, however, such as Hand of Fate, in their endless pursuit of knowledge.
	Although a few occultists remain in one place, most choose to travel throughout the realms. They are fascinated by ancient civilizations and eagerly seek out archeological sites to learn the secrets of the past. The ruins of a once-great city, the tomb of a long-dead emperor, the abandoned castle of a vanished regent, or a vast underground library filled with decaying tomes-the occultist greets each with wonder and a voracious appetite for knowledge.
	Occultists apprentice themselves to willing masters, but they also attempt to bind powerful creatures to their service. In their quest to understand the nature of existence, they do not let abstract concepts such as morality stand in their way. They are just as likely to study a fiendish prince as they are a celestial servitor, although the former is more likely to kill the student than to impart any wisdom.
	When dealing with powerful extraplanar entities, be they demons, primordials, or agents of deities, occultists learn to tread carefully. They scour the realms for arcane and divine rituals, collecting items such as sorcerous dust and blessed candles that can be incorporated into rituals to create warding circles. In this way they can safely imprison unwilling subjects, or bargain with the dark forces they summon without losing their heads in the process.

Creating:
Anyone who seeks to interpret the meaning of the universe through signs and symbols can become an occultist. Wizards and clerics of deities such as Ioun, Gond, or Oghma are typical, since they possess the required skills to understand ancient texts and obscure arcana. Warlocks (such as binders and hexblades) are also common, with their penchant for forging pacts or striking deals with dark forces. Although occultists can come from any race, they are most often tieflings, gnomes, and humans.

Most inquisitives labor as private detectives, operate in urban areas (although their investigations can take them far afield), and work alone or with a small group of close associates. Those in larger cities, however, sometimes band together to form detective agencies or professional guilds. Such agencies might employ one to four inquisitives, as well as support staff such as alchemists, sages, and diviners. The larger and most successful organizations might have over a dozen detectives and numerous other operatives. Inquisitives who work independently or in smaller towns might operate out of taverns, restaurants, or even their own homes.
	Because the profession is not legal or welcome in every jurisdiction, inquisitives can have a complicated relationship with local law enforcement. Some watch commanders and local constables view inquisitives as necessary evils, despite keeping several on retainer to investigate complex or high-profile crimes. Overwhelmed subordinates can have a much more pragmatic view. Thus, a successful inquisitive cultivates reciprocal relationships with low-ranking officers and watch members, since they're an excellent source of jobs, information, and favors.
	Inquisitives perform a wide variety of services that can be grouped into three broad categories: criminal investigation, crime prevention, and information acquisition. Most inquisitives will take on any such cases. Some inquisitives and their agencies, however, especially those located in larger cities, specialize in a particular field. To solve cases, inquisitives utilize magic and skills to analyze evidence, conduct surveillance, interview witnesses, interrogate suspects, and obtain privileged information by using a network of informants.
	Criminal Investigation: Inquisitives investigate crimes ranging from petty theft to murder that official law enforcement is unwilling, unable, or ill equipped to handle. Indeed, many of the victims, who are often poor or otherwise marginalized, are suspicious of the watch due to corruption, discrimination, or their own criminal history. Wrongfully accused clients or their families might hire inquisitives to prove their innocence. Sometimes inquisitives are better suited to conducting an investigation because they're likely to have the necessary experience and resources, such as access to divination rituals. City watches often hire inquisitives (both officially and unofficially) as investigators or consultants when confronted with difficult cases, especially those involving magic, the supernatural, or the crossing of jurisdictional boundaries.
	Crime Prevention: Thwarting crime before it happens is an extremely lucrative endeavor, since those who can afford these types of services are usually quite wealthy. Such activities include mundane background checks, foiling blackmail or extortion schemes, preventing industrial espionage, and uncovering assassination plots. The work is surprisingly dangerous because the wealthy tend to have powerful and well-connected enemies who don't take kindly to inquisitives poking around.
	Information Gathering: The majority of cases undertaken by inquisitives involve the acquisition or recovery of embarrassing, lost, or secret information. People hire inquisitives to uncover evidence of adultery, locate missing family members, dig up dirt on enemies, and evaluate potential business opportunities.
	Additional Services: Crooked inquisitives also engage in all manner of questionable or criminal activities, such as campaigns of harassment, strikebreaking, sabotage, blackmail, and even murder. Furthermore, many outwardly respectable agencies provide such services for the right price.

Creating:
To be successful, an inquisitive needs to be analytical, devious, quick-witted, perceptive, sociable, and handy in a fight. As a result, the profession attracts those who excel at many skills and are proficient in closequarters combat, such as assassins, bards, rangers, and rogues. In addition, scholarly folk such as wizards and psions, especially those who can influence the actions and thoughts of others, make excellent inquisitives, given their magical talents and breadth of knowledge. Being able to perform rituals or brew alchemical concoctions is also a boon.
	Inquisitives come from all walks of life and can be a member of any race. Since disguises are a useful trick of the trade, shapeshifting races such as changelings and hengeyokai have an obvious advantage, and many work in the profession. In Eberron, most inquisitives are human, half-elf, or half-orc (reflecting the heritage of the dominant dragonmarked houses), but goblins, who make up much of Khorvaire's urban underclass, often work as inquisitives in their own neighborhoods, which suffer from neglect by local law enforcement.

Every inquisitive has an inquisitive's kit. This kit includes several containers made from different materials, brushes, mundane dusts, tweezers, picks, probes, a magnifying glass, ink and quills, parchment, and a small journal. An inquisitive's kit grants a +2 bonus to Perception checks to search an area for something specific. If you ever lose the kit, it costs 40 gp to replace.

Most adventurers stick out like a troll among halflings when placed in courtly situations. They see only a bunch of nobles and retainers fawning over one another in incomprehensible ways with little relevance to their lives.
	A courtier knows better. A battle rages amid the smiles and niceties of court. Each word is a carefully calculated move, each meeting a play for political power, and each friend another piece in the game of court. A single mistake can mean the difference between acquiring a powerful position and being clapped in irons.
	A courtier sees unique solutions to a problem. When confronted by a wicked duke, a typical adventurer might launch an assault on his keep or try to assassinate him. A courtier might instead go to the king and plant the idea that the duke's wicked acts are a political liability. The villainous duke could soon be stripped of his lands and titles, thus ending his threat just as effectively.

Creating:
Canny adventurers can earn a position at court by using their talents to gain an extra edge. Court wizards are quite common, since their wise counsel and arcane knowledge can prove invaluable to a ruler. Many less scrupulous courtiers choose the path of the rogue to steal secret documents. Bards are frequent visitors in royal circles, and some are intrigued by the games of politics. Even a warlord can hold a position at court after achieving a noteworthy victory. As many second-born scions and ambitious merchants can tell you, anyone can gain a place at court with the right connections and skills.

Requirements:
You must be trained in Diplomacy. The games of court are about winning allies and subtle persuasion, which is impossible without at least some knowledge of the art of diplomacy.

A secret war is waged in the city—a war of information. On the front line of this war, the spy excels. A city's ruler might retain a network of spies to root out enemies. Ambitious nobles can recruit spies to find new avenues of power. Those who can't maneuver this web of secrets are doomed to failure.
	Spies must work carefully amidst potential enemies. A spy can be anyone and no one, spiriting away vital information before disappearing to pursue the next secret. Drawing suspicion can lead to capture or death. Thus, spies who survive are highly skilled and adapt quickly to their environment. Some are trained in secret academies within the city while others are self-taught. Some hold great loyalty to their patrons while others are purely mercenary. And in the end, spies receive little glory; in fact, the best spies aren't even noticed at all.
	Spies always report to someone, so work with your DM to choose a patron. Playing a spy representing an important person or organization in the campaign can be a great way to make your character feel tied to the world. You can choose to let the other players know your character's purpose or keep it a secret between you and the DM, creating a deeper sense of intrigue.

Creating:
To do their jobs, spies rely on remaining unsuspected. Bards make excellent spies, since they can easily mingle in all social circles. Wizards and warlocks can also take on this role, using subtle magic to aid them. Some churches even train avengers to act as spies against the enemies of their god. The majority of adventuring spies, however, are rogues; their diverse skills and stealthy natures lend themselves naturally to the needs of the profession.

In even the noblest kingdoms, justice can fall by the wayside, and in corrupt or evil ones, villains can often escape fair judgment. Most people stand by and let this pass, but some have a passion for justice that won't submit to impotent laws. These few take personal charge of seeking out evil and punishing it as they see fit. These people are vigilantes.
	Vigilantes operate outside the law and therefore must be careful about how they enforce their justice. Many hide their true identities behind simple black masks or more elaborate disguises. They must work at night, out of sight of the city watch and their criminal enemies. They are often forced to travel in unorthodox ways, sprinting over city rooftops or skulking through dark alleys and sewers.
	A vigilante's impact goes beyond his or her direct work. Vigilantes know that fear of their vengeance can deter would-be evildoers. So, they use dramatic and flamboyant fighting styles to draw their enemies' attention. Further, they often leave a distinctive token with those they bring to justice, ranging from the symbolic, such as a dead rose, to the gruesome, such as carving their symbol into an enemy's flesh.
	The common folk develop strong opinions about vigilantes, sometimes labeling them heroes while fearing them as dangerous criminals at other times. It is up to each vigilante to establish a legacy that is most true to his or her brand of justice.
	Most vigilantes keep their true identities a secret to evade their enemies. If you want to have a secret identity, work with the DM to determine what you would like it to be. Do you always adventure as your vigilante identity or do you sometimes go about as your true self? Do your companions know who you truly are? These character aspects can be exciting hooks for interesting roleplaying.

Creating:
Many events can lead a character to become a vigilante. A person might possess a strong desire for justice and be unable to stand idly by while innocents suffer. Another might be avenging a personal loss.
	Rogues with a strong moral code might become vigilantes, since they are probably already accustomed to operating outside of the law. Fighters and rangers possess the athleticism that lends itself well to the strain of running over rooftops at night. Avengers are drawn to the path of the vigilante as the executors of their god's will. In the darkest societies, paladins can also become vigilantes due to their rigid moral codes, though they must be careful that the lawless nature of vigilante justice does not lead to their corruption.

History litters the worlds featured in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons® game. Old statues of people long forgotten stand in mute battle against the creepers and overgrowth. Crumbling ruins, toppled walls, and cracked buildings that are now home to the creatures of the wild still echo with the drama that once unfolded there. Even the dungeons that adventurers explore—built for reasons long lost, for purposes now inscrutable—can trace their origins back to the murky times gone by. The past is all around—in the wreckage of fallen kingdoms and empires, in the memorials raised to commemorate significant people and events, and in the names of heroes and villains that still resound through the centuries. For most, history is what has already happened—the events that have shaped the present. But for you, history was yesterday. Born in an age far removed from the present, you were a member of the civlizations that transformed the world. You might have dwelled among the fiends of Bael Turath or the dragons of Arkhosia, taken leisurely strolls within the stunning city of Myth Drannor, or fought bravely amid the armies of the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan. You witnessed these nations at their heights, when their lights shone the brightest, and you experienced the incredible grandeur and majesty of your civilization. Everything seemed possible.
	But now, you are here—or, to be more precise, you are now, stuck in the current and very dark age. How did you come to be here and now? Perhaps it was an accident. Perhaps you were placed in stasis as punishment for crimes you did or didn't commit, or as part of a magical experiment into the nature of time. Some magical calamity might have flung you forward, hurling you through the long centuries to emerge in a world far removed from the one you remember. However you made the journey, you now inhabit a changed world. The people you knew are bones and dust. The cities you loved so well are now reduced to monster-infested ruins. The life you led is a fading memory that only you recall.
	Now you must make a choice. Do you lament the past you lost and curse this unforeseen future, or do you embrace this new, savage world? Or, perhaps, will you try to recapture the light that was lost and restore your old, forgotten realm? Only this time, under your guidance, the empire might stand the test of time.

Creating:
The first step in creating a ghost of the past is to determine where and when your character came from. In what era was he born? What nation did she call her own? If you're playing in the D&amp;D® world of Nerath, you might choose one of the legendary empires,such as Bael Turath or Arkhosia. If you're playing in a D&amp;D campaign setting, such as the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, or Dragonlance settings, you can pick from any of the civilizations that predate the campaign's current time. In the Greyhawk setting, your character might hail from the ancient Suloise Empire, before the Twin Cataclysms that reduced that nation to ashes. In the Dragonlance setting, you might have been a contemporary of Huma—a witness and possibly a participant in the Third Dragon War. And in the Forgotten Realms setting, you might have taken part in the Fall of Netheril, been present for the founding of Cormyr, or walked the streets of Myth Drannor.
	If you're playing in a published world or one created by your group, talk to your Dungeon Master about the time from which your character comes, the place he or she called home, and the things he or she should know. When choosing a race, be mindful of the people who lived in the character's civilization. If your character comes from Bael Turath, odds are the character is a human or tiefling. He or she is probably dragonborn if the character came from Arkhosia. Your class choices should also reflect your character's unusual origins.
	Regardless of race and class, the virtues and vices of an ancient civilization formed your character's personality. His or her behavior and mindset might seem alien to those living in the present. When selecting feats and powers, you can emphasize your character's nature by making choices that are unusual for the group.
	As a final detail, determine how your character learned the Common language. He or she might be the product of an excellent educational system and therefore a quick learner, or the language might be part of the magic that sent the character across time. Alternatively, perhaps everybody speaks the character's language—the Common tongue may be all that remains of his or her empire.

The world's twisting waterways create a pathway for trade between realms, with rivers and shorelines connecting goods to eager merchants in many cities. Wealth trickles up, not down, among the merchantbarons who own the wharfs. As gold moves from gilded hand to gilded hand, the low-born of harbor districts are fated to lives of poverty or crime. Those who dare to strive against the dockside thugs, robbers, and killers find their daily life a game of cat and mouse. But the crafty ones ensure that this is one game the mouse always wins.
	Such are the river rats, underworld survivors who thrive at the risks, excess, and thrills of a life that follows the world's waterways. Be it reveling in a quayside tavern or prowling among the reeds, a river rat exemplifies someone who rises in the face of threats rather than shrinks from them. When danger appears, the river rat smiles, cracks his or her knuckles, and asks, "Are you talking to me?"

Creating:
Any class might be drawn to the river rat lifestyle, but those well suited to rough encounters using words and steel live the longest. The typical river rat is a rogue, using the class's diverse skill set and precise martial prowess to outshine the competition. Classes with the defender role, especially the fighter, make exceptional river rats as well. These classes give the character the grit to reflect the river rat's unique tenacity and eagerness to throw down with opponents. River rats who spend the majority of their time on the fringes of civilization might be better suited as rangers, being masters of the rivers that crisscross the world. Few arcane or divine classes are suited to the gritty circumstances of the river rat's life, although druids who are attuned to the spirits of a city's alleys and streets could make for an unconventional river rat. In fact, a druid could make the river rat title literal through the use of the skittering sneak power. Halflings and gnomes make ideal river rats, their pint-sized stature belying a larger-than-life persona. Regardless of class, river rats have skills or personalities that make them comfortable in urban environments.

The cities of the sorcerer-kings crouch upon the backs of slaves. Slave bones litter their alleys. Slave blood makes mud in the dust of their streets. Almost everywhere you go in the city-states you see someone with a yoke around the neck and eyes cast toward the ground. Tyr presents the only exception, but Tyr has depended upon the labor of slaves just as much as any other city. Even it sells criminals into slavery beyond its walls. How long can such “freedom” last?
	Slaves have always been a part of Athasian society. A harsh world calls for harsh justice. Those who cannot obey the laws that protect all or who are not smart enough to bow before those stronger than themselves do not deserve the water it takes to keep them alive. People become slaves by angering or offending those more powerful than themselves. A slave might have owed a debt, stolen a crust of bread, or not bowed low or fast enough when a person of importance passed. Citizens are declared slaves for owning items desired by nobles, for being captured instead of killed during war, and for knowing information above their station. Those born to slaves are slaves owned by the mother's master. After all, the master lost work from the mother during pregnancy and must pay for the child's care. Such a child owes the master labor equal to the period of time until it can do the work of a full adult, and by then it has no doubt done something to warrant its continued slavery. Even the kindest master realizes that a child raised in slavery is ill equipped for freedom and would likely die shortly after release. Though a slave lives a harsh life with no security, a master must provide for a slave's needs or accept the loss of that investment.
	Once declared a slave, a person becomes property. Slaves change hands like money. They are won and lost in bets, sold at auction, and brought to market. Slave owners with slaves that have specialized skills or unusual attributes seek out buyers with particular needs. A slave owner can do what he or she likes with a slave, and it's no concern of anyone else. Masters expect slaves to work incredibly hard to earn their keep or face death in the arena, a quick execution, or whatever other cruelty the master dreams up.
	Few slaves even dream of escape. The declaration of slavery is like a death sentence in its finality. Even if the leather and bone manacles are broken, even if the guards are evaded or killed, the rest of the world hates and fears an escaped slave. Those who aid an escaped slave-even unwittingly-can expect to become slaves themselves. Those who turn them in often receive a reward worth as much as half the slave's value. Only Tyr offers a slim hope of sanctuary, and if a slave has angered the master enough, many ways exist to take someone from that city.
	An escaped slave's only hope is to see freedom as a rebirth. Old haunts, one-time friends, even family-all need to be avoided for fear of being recognized and turned in. Hide the brand, disguise the tattoo, cover up the scars, explain the calluses away-successful escaped slaves do all this and more. Escaped slaves must take up a new name, a new history, and if one can manage it, a new appearance. Some escaped slaves do all this, but the strong will and sharp mind such a life requires often drives successful escaped slaves back toward their former owners, exchanging one master for another: revenge.
Creating: Some slaves are sent to the arena as gladiators, but escaped slaves likely served their owners in some other capacity. Some toiled beneath the burning sun while others groaned in the shade as they bore fat masters on palanquins. An escaped slave might have belonged to a merchant, a noble, or even a sorcerer-king. An escaped slave might have fled from the watchful eye of an artisan who owns no others or from the vast retinue of a plantation owner.
	Rogues, bards, assassins, and others with a penchant for deceit make good choices for an escaped slave. The theme powers present useful abilities for melee combatants, but those who seek to hide their skills and avoid melee attacks, such as arcane casters or bow-wielding characters, might find the escaped slave theme useful. As a heroic escaped slave, your character might have learned the abilities of his or her class powers after escaping. Alternatively, your character's class might represent who he or she was before becoming enslaved. Perhaps your character hid these talents while owned by another, or maybe you put your abilities to use for your former master.
