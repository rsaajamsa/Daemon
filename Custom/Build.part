The use of psionic power is widespread on Athas, and many warriors take up the career of the battlemind. Battleminds are hardy and cunning, two characteristics essential to survival on Athas. Self-taught or informally trained, wild battleminds rely on instinct. These battleminds channel raw psionic energy fueled by their untamed emotions. They often develop their powers as a result of a traumatic or a dangerous experience that triggers their psionic talent as a defense mechanism.
	The wild battlemind is the most common type of battlemind on Athas. These individuals live in the wastes or the slums, growing up without the privileges afforded to nobles who receive formal training in the Way. The aggressive, powerful attacks of a wild battlemind reflect the brutality of life under the red sun. It's not unusual for a wild battlemind to end up as a gladiator in the arenas of Athas.
	The deadly and unpredictable wild battleminds are born to be warriors. From an early age, they learn the ways of psionic combat through trial and error. They often craft their own weapons, chipping away at shards of obsidian or lashing together bones and teeth. They favor two-handed weapons, which they can use to great effect in battle.
	Like other battleminds, you should make Constitution your primary ability score, because you use it to make your psionic attacks. Choose Charisma as your secondary ability score. Charisma improves your Wild Focus class feature and enhances many of your battlemind powers. Select Wisdom as your tertiary ability score if you want to dabble in powers from other battlemind builds.

Years spent in death matches, squaring off against humanoid and monstrous foes, have prepared you to face any enemy. You learned to fight by scrapping in the sand and struggling against the arena-masters' pets. You are a cut above the rest, a champion born of the arenas of Athas and destined for much more.
	You bring cunning and speed to the battlefield. You have a daring unknown to those whose feet have never touched the arena floor. Rather than hide behind heavy armor, you rely on agility and your mastery of weapons to deflect your enemies' attacks. Unburdened by heavy armor, you can leap into the fray to strike several enemies at once.
	The arena lures more fighters to its bloody fields than members of any other class. Fighters have the weapon training, the armor training, and the adaptability to respond to a variety of threats. Any fighter build might be appropriate in Athas's arenas, but the arena fighter represents the epitome of combat in the coliseums.
	As with other fighters, Strength should be your highest ability score, because you use it for your attack powers. You'll wear light armor, so a high Dexterity can help offset your lower Armor Class. Make Dexterity your second-highest ability score. Choose Wisdom as your tertiary ability score if you want to improve your battlefield intuition and your Will defense, or pick Constitution if you need extra hit points and healing surges. Select powers that increase your mobility and help you control the battlefield. The ideal powers let you strike or hinder several enemies. Your secondary role is controller.

Although the world is no longer green and alive, primal spirits still haunt the land. Mesas, crags, dunes, salt pans, siroccos, sandstorms—all contain spirits just as the forests and the oases do. These spirits born of the land are deeply infused with the powers of the elements, and they care little for other creatures. They can be sullen and wrathful entities, but you are able to bend them to your will.
	You know how to call forth the desert spirits of sand and sun. The primal spirits you conjure exhibit the land's characteristics. A spirit might shed rain droplets, erupt in blazing fire, or stir one's hair as winds gust around it. Under your command, the spirits rage, unleashing their fury to smash and burn everything in their path. Through force of will, you compel the spirits, binding their power to your allies' attacks or directing them to loose their anger against your enemies.
	As an animist shaman, you command a spirit companion more elemental in nature than the spirit companions of other shamans. This elemental spirit might appear as a vortex of dust, a curtain of evaporating rain, a clattering gyre of pebbles, or any other desert phenomenon.
	You need Wisdom for your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next best score, because it helps boost the damage and benefits of your powers. A high Constitution increases your hit points and your Fortitude, so it should be your third-best score. Look for powers that let your allies make attacks, improve their attacks, or inhibit foes through zones and debilitating effects. Your secondary role is controller.

    </rules>
On Athas, many templars swear an oath to a sorcerer-king in exchange for arcane power. The sorcerer-king pact reflects the training and magical transformations that a sorcerer-king might provide to an individual whom he or she deems worthy. A warlock who has this pact can draw on the reserves of power that a sorcerer-king commands.
	Most warlocks of this pact are templars in a sorcerer-king's service. They are often trusted members of the templar hierarchy who are expected to command the soldiers, the agents, or the underlings of a sorcerer-king. Thus, the powers of the sorcererking pact aid allies and work well in melee. A sorcerer-king sometimes imparts his or her power to a promising protégé or a privileged noble without making the recipient into a templar, although such instances are unusual.
	The sorcerer-kings desire servants who have great stamina and force of personality, so Charisma or Constitution should be the primary ability score for someone who has this pact. Intelligence is best as your secondary ability score, because many sorcerer-king pact powers gain a benefit from it. Charisma or Constitution, whichever you didn't pick as a primary score, is a good third choice. Choose Charisma to bolster your low Will defense if you plan to remain at range, or else use Constitution to gain extra hit points and healing surges if you intend to use your powers in melee combat.

The world is yours to shape as you desire. You channel the latent psionic energy in your environment, molding it to serve your needs. You shape psionic power to unleash lethal attacks or conjure useful objects from your own mind. With the right focus and power, you can even create creatures that do your bidding.
	Summoned creatures are the foundation of your shaper psion tactics. Such creatures are created only through your daily disciplines. Call on them sparingly, and choose at-will and encounter disciplines that support this theme.
	As it does for all psions, Intelligence powers your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Charisma is an important secondary ability for a shaper, since it helps you control or empower your creations. Since summoned creatures depend on your hit points, you should also keep your Constitution high. Conjuration and summoning powers allow you to make the most of your secondary role as leader.

You are a cunning warrior, adapting your combat style to meet whatever threat you face. You leap into battle, ripping through your opponents with blindingly fast attacks designed to distract and confuse. Before your foes can react, you settle into a ready posture, deflecting counterstrikes with your weapons.
	You are a monk, trained in fighting techniques that transform your hands and feet into deadly weapons. You differ from your kin in the Centered Breath and Stone Fist schools by virtue of the dedication you put into weapon training. You choose the weapons of the common folk, including the mace, staff, spear, and dagger. Your unique training then allows you to treat those weapons as extensions of your body, making them far more deadly than they would be in the hands of any other warrior. Your psionic power infuses your strikes with speed and accuracy.
	Like other monks, you should put your highest score in Dexterity because you depend on it for your attacks. Its origin among the common folk means that the Iron Soul tradition focuses on toughness, so make Constitution your second highest score. Aside from the specific full disciplines that rely on Constitution, additional hit points and healing surges are useful for keeping you in the fight. Consider making Wisdom your third highest ability score to increase your battlefield awareness and your Will.

As a harrier battlemind, you move with ease across the battlefield, whether taking the fight to your enemies or falling back to draw them closer to you. Choose powers that facilitate movement, with teleportation powers being the most important. Your secondary role is controller, which can be strengthened by area powers that manipulate or hamper your opponents. Your feat selection should improve your defenses and mobility.
	Make Constitution your highest ability score. Dexterity should be your second-highest score, getting you into the fight quickly and letting you avoid heavy armor to keep moving at full speed in combat. A high Wisdom allows you to improve your battlefield awareness, and Charisma remains important for the many battlemind disciplines that rely on that skill.

Impetuous ardents have little use for caution or careful planning, and they allow their natural talent and fate to guide their actions. As an impetuous ardent, your secondary role is striker. Choose powers that deliver punishing damage, improve your allies' attacks, or strip away your enemies' ability to protect themselves. Any power that can help to quickly remove an enemy's threat reinforces your preferred tactics. This said, wading through enemies places you at great risk. To mitigate the dangers arrayed against you, be sure to invest in feats and powers that help you last in combat.
	Charisma should be your highest ability score. Look to your Dexterity score next to let you act sooner in the round and to keep your Reflex high. Round out your defenses and hit points by making Constitution your third highest ability score.

As a defiant runepriest, you fight on the front lines, sustaining and aiding your allies with divine runes. You focus your efforts on the most dangerous enemies, using your magic to restrict their attacks and shield your allies from harm. Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom.

As your allies charge into battle, you hang back and take cover. While swords swing and spells explode, you carefully choose your target, line up your shot, and fire. The enemy staggers from your deadly attack, and by the time it has begun to look for you, you've vanished. You send death hurtling from your crossbow or sling, relentlessly assaulting your enemies. You pepper your foes with missiles, lending support to your allies without risking your own skin.
Shadowy rogues use powers that improve concealment and cover. Shadowy rogues want powers they can use from range, though it's a good idea to pick a few melee powers as well. Any powers that let you move as part of your attack are excellent choices, because they can help you become hidden using the Cunning Sneak class feature.

Druids call on forces associated with primal magic, such as beasts, plants, storms, and the earth. Swarm druids prefer to call on a particular primal force: insect swarms. Such druids see great strength in the unity of purpose and combined might of a colony of ants or a nest of hornets.

Most druids assume the forms of creatures such as bears, panthers, and rams, but a swarm druid splinters into hundreds of insects, all driven toward a single purpose by the druid's mind. The druid is at once all the creatures in the swarm and none of them. Enemies might stomp at the swarm, crushing a beetle here and swatting a wasp there, but to the druid the loss of an individual in the swarm means nothing. It is the swarm as a whole—a dauntless tide of chitin and stingers—that matters.

Swarm druids are most often found in tropical climates. They typically dwell in jungles, where they have witnessed the power of an ant colony on the march. Druids of the Underdark also tend toward this discipline. In web-shrouded caves, drow and troglodyte swarm druids commune with spiders, mushroom forests, and creatures that have never seen the light of day.

When you stride into battle, low thunder rumbles around you. Even underground or on a clear day, the deep-throated murmur of distant storms accompanies you.

You have studied the raw stuff of shadow and can use your abilities to manipulate and control the shadows cast by your enemies. At your command, shadows become physical objects that reach forth to grab and crush your foes, or hold them still while you ready a killing blow. Constitution should be your second highest ability score, after Dexterity. Charisma is a good third choice, to buoy your Will. Choose the Bleak Disciple option for your Guild Training class feature.

As a shielding cleric, you believe that your place is not to take the fight to the enemy directly, but to bolster allies with your presence. Your prayers lend additional resources to your friends and create opportunities for them to defeat their foes. Yours is a life of leadership through self-sacrifice, ongoing support, and inspiration. You do not seek personal glory, and you take comfort in knowing that your allies couldn't have succeeded without you.
Wisdom is your most important ability, since the prayers that support your tactics rely on it. Charisma is a vital secondary ability, making many of your prayers more effective. A good Strength is important if you intend to take melee powers. You should select powers that emphasize your role as healer and facilitator.

You are a tower of faith; enchantments and dreadful powers wielded by your foes can find little purchase in your devoted heart.

No matter how your enemies attack you, you excel at resisting conditions that would impede others. As a warrior of exceptional piety, you also make more use of your holy symbol than other paladins do. You have several options for engaging enemies at range, so that even foes beyond your weapon's reach cannot escape your challenge.
Your highest ability score should be Charisma. Choose Wisdom for your second-best score, since a good Wisdom enhances the effects of many of your powers. Strength should be your third-best score. First choose powers that let you make extra saving throws or use healing surges, then powers that bolster your allies or deal high damage. You should wield a shield and a one-handed weapon, since having high defenses is a goal of this build.

Your brutal assaults demonstrate the power of your god's wrath. You're more like a striker than other paladins are. You willingly sacrifice your own health and defense to strike down your foes, even giving up some healing ability to be a more powerful attacker. The ardent vow power allows you to focus on a specific opponent, dealing additional damage with attacks and keeping that foe's attention on you. This power also enhances powers that work better against enemies marked by you.
Take Strength as your highest ability score, since you use it for many attacks and damage. Wisdom should be your second-highest score, to maximize the number of uses you get of ardent vow. A good Constitution score can help soothe the sting of powers that require you to spend some of your own hit points for best effect. Because of this build's focus on dealing damage, choose a weapon with the best possible damage capacity, typically a two-handed weapon.

These words of power come from the gods' lexicon, the very words of creation. The words are frequently too potent for mortals, imperiling the health and sanity of those who speak them. Malediction invokers need a high Wisdom score to intone the words properly and to piece together the inflections and holy grammar required to use the words in battle. Words of power bear a physical price, so malediction invokers should consider making Constitution their second highest ability, followed closely by Intelligence.

Charisma follows as a close second, essential for getting your way by using Intimidate. Strength comes in third; it's useful in delivering brutal attacks if you employ the Ruthless Ruffian tactic.

All rogues are known for their agility and daring, but you take both to the next level. Ducking under a giant's club isn't enough; you leap over it and cartwheel to safety. You're a masterful mover and an expert top-story burglar, using your abilities to tumble into the fray, into high openings, and out of all sorts of tight spots. Dexterity is your primary ability score, because you rely on it for your attacks and acrobatic stunts. Charisma is secondary for you, useful in avoiding opportunity attacks if you employ the Artful Dodger tactic. Strength serves you well as a tertiary ability, helping your Athletics checks in particular.

A deadly hunter, you specialize in double-teaming your enemies with the aid of a beast companion. Your beast is an extension of you, and thereby it is an invaluable member of your group. No other is needed to help you flank your quarry. Melee combat with the aid of your beast is your focus, so you favor Strength. You count on Dexterity for your AC and occasional ranged attacks, so your secondary focus is on that ability score. Wisdom, your tertiary ability score, makes you better at the Perception skill and gives you an edge with many ranger powers. The Beast Mastery class feature is designed to complement this build.

Rather than a shield or a big weapon, you have specialized in fighting using a weapon in each hand. You see it as the best of both worlds—given the right training, you can deliver good damage and make up for the lack of a shield with deft parrying. Strength remains any soldier's bread and butter, and good battlefield awareness—Wisdom—is a must. You also rely on speed, maneuverability, and agility—Dexterity—to get your dirty work done. Constitution is a tertiary ability for you, granting useful staying power against foes not so easily fooled by your fancy footwork and feints. The Tempest Technique class feature is designed to complement this build.

You're an unpredictable warrior who trusts the adrenaline rush of battle to pull you through as much as heavy armor does. Few aspects of life give you the charge that being in the heat of battle does, and you build up a fury when your enemies manage to hurt you. You thrive on taking it to those foes by wielding highly damaging weapons such as axes, maces, hammers, and picks. Strength is your focus, allowing you to make powerful attacks. You rely on Constitution to give weight to your attacks and to keep you in the fight. Like any other soldier, you count on brutal instinct to help you win the day, so Wisdom is important to you as well. The Battlerager Vigor class feature is designed to complement this build.

A decent Intelligence score is useful for improving your Armor Class and Reflex defense, as well as boosting the knowledge skills that you often use.

You lead through a combination of daring attacks and aggressive tactics. Using your powers is risky, but the rewards for success are great. You help your allies find the nerve to profit from bold maneuvers and punch into enemies head-on. Compared to other warlords, you're oriented more toward handling heavy fighting yourself, and your attack powers rely mainly on Strength. Charisma is your second priority, for it lets you get away with your audacious stunts yet maintain the respect of your comrades. Mental acuity and quick reflexes in battle are valuable to any warlord, so Intelligence is also important to you. The Bravura Presence class feature is designed to complement this build.

To your mind, the ancient heroes most worthy of emulation are those whose courage in the face of overwhelming odds carried them to victory. Your own fortitude and forceful personality inspire similar valor in your allies. Your highest ability score should be Charisma, since you use it for attack powers, followed by Constitution to improve your powers of inspiration.

You protect your allies with magical shields of force—and by keeping enemies away from them. This heritage is embodied by the Coronal Guard tradition, a discipline that can be traced over a thousand years to the armathors, the elite guards of the coronal of Myth Drannor. Intelligence powers your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Constitution applies added effects to many of your attacks, so it should be your second-highest score. A good Strength lets you take advantage of assault swordmage powers (giving you some added offense) and keeps your basic attack decent. You'll want to keep a hand free to get your AC bonus from Swordmage Warding class feature, so you should use a one-handed weapon such as a longsword or a scimitar.

Your style of combat focuses on flashy attacks that call up elemental forces and throw your opponents around the battlefield. This method of aggressive swordmage combat spread from Returned Abeir to Toril through the heritage of the anarchs of Shyr. Your attacks use Intelligence, so that should be your primary ability score. Strength should be your second-best ability score, since it enhances your assault powers and keeps your base attack bonus high. Constitution helps your survivability and can be useful if you want to try some shielding swordmage powers. Most assault swordmages use a two-handed weapon (such as a greatsword or a falchion) to deal more damage, though they have a lower AC as a result.

You like powers that deceive and misdirect your foes. You dart in and out of the fray in combat, dodging your enemies' attacks or redirecting them to other foes. Most of your attack powers rely on Dexterity, so that should be your best ability score. Charisma is important for a few attacks, for Charisma-based skills you sometimes use in place of attacks, and for other effects that depend on successful attacks, so make Charisma your second-best score. Strength is useful if you want to choose powers intended for the other rogue build. Select the artful dodger rogue tactic. Look for powers that take advantage of your high Charisma score, as well as those that add to your trickster nature.

No subtlety here—you want to deal damage. You're tougher than the deceptive warlock, and you've got powers to help you attack and defend in melee, as well as excellent ranged attacks. Your best attack powers depend on Constitution—make that your best ability score. Choose Intelligence second because it provides special bonuses to many of your powers and improves your Reflex defense and AC, too. Charisma is clearly your third choice.
	Scourge warlocks should choose the infernal pact or the star pact (see “Class Features”).

You prefer spells that deal a little less damage, but that inflict a variety of penalties and negative conditions on your foe. You'd rather fight at range and avoid getting caught in close-up battles. Most of your attack powers depend on Charisma, so that should be your best score. Many of your powers receive a bonus if you have a good Intelligence score, so that should be your second-best score. Constitution should be your third choice since you might want to choose some Constitution-based powers. You need it for a good Fortitude defense anyway.

You emphasize defense, guarding your allies, and healing and bolstering them with a few of your powers. You do not deal as much damage as the avenging paladin, but you are better at dealing with a wider array of situations. Your best ability score should be Charisma. Choose Strength for your second-best score (you'll want a few Strength-based attacks), and Wisdom as your third-best score. The protecting paladin works best as a shield-carrying warrior, so you should probably use a heavy shield and a one-handed weapon such as a longsword or a warhammer. Select powers that help your allies, along with a few damage-dealing powers for when the need arises.
