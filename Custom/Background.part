    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> From the day you were born, you were told the tales of blood and bravery that marked the empire's fall. As a child, you played out the ancient battles whose names were among the first words you learned, but Nerath was never more than stories to you. Or so it was until you first felt the spark of psionic power that marked you as a battlemind. With that power came a knowledge that filled you like a ghostly chorus—the memory of a dozen lifetimes never lived, tracing back to the last of the Ghost Blades.
	Whether or not you sought the role, you are a ghost of Nerath fated to search for the signs that will herald the empire's rise from the ashes. Do you have the strength to take up a quest whose conclusion might lie long after your own death? Can you set aside the need for love and family, hearth and home to wander the world in search of the vague and elusive signs? Do you dare to consider that you might be the most important of those signs and scion to a bloodline long thought lost? </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Long before you came into your psionic powers, you had a knack for reading the emotions in other people. You could always tell when something was wrong, bond with people who liked you, and sever connections with those who meant you harm. Close friends marveled when you finished their sentences. You had a gift, a talent that revealed itself in a profound way when you came into the fullness of your psionic ability. Your childhood tricks evolved into something more, until you could almost hear people's thoughts and read their moods and emotions as if they were words on a page. </specific>

You could have been stationed outside the border of the vale in which it resides, always on the lookout for creatures that somehow pass through the illusion of the lake and enter the magical valley uninvited.

But a threat lurks in the shadows of a nearby forest. Once, beasts and blood ran in the Baldur's Gate streets, and the city came within a whisker of being ruled by the mooncursed. Grand Duke Valarken recently attempted a coup, backed by the werewolves of the Band of the Red Moon, but his defeat sent them all back to the Werewoods, the forest you called home. You don't know the Duke's fate, but you do know the Band of the Red Moon has grand designs on the region.
  You come from Vehlarr, an ancient territory that has become legend. Established centuries ago by its elf werewolf ruler, this city of lycanthropes, elves, and shifters floats in time and space, an effect created by Selune long before the Spellplague. Now it appears only under the full moon, existing both in the Werewood and the Feywild, forming an unstable bridge between planes. Though centuries have passed since its unmooring in the world, Vehlarr has felt only 75 years of that time.
  You grew up in Vehlarr, feeling the erratic influence of both worlds. When you learned of the Band of the Red Moon's expansion plans, you felt you had to help. You disregarded the warnings of your leaders and left, but you waited too long. By the time you reached Baldur's Gate, the Band of the Red Moon had come and gone. Now you can't return home for fear of the welcome you'll get from the werewolves. And their anger at your betrayal will remain fresh for a very long time. </specific>

A man stops dead in his tracks, then heads home at a run after seeing bits of blood and fur on a neighbor's doorframe. Such is life in the Dalelands, particularly in Daggerdale.
  Surrounded by hilly forests and rocky, mazelike canyons, the citizens of isolated Daggerdale live in fear of werecreatures striking their villages in the night. The dale has never been a place friendly to outsiders, and shifters are viewed with particular suspicion. Strangers could be lycanthropes in disguise, and the folk of Daggerdale have little doubt that shifters run with the monsters that infest the craggy heights of the Dagger Hills.
  You are a shifter related to the lycanthropes that plague the dale. Perhaps you grew to hate the leaders of your kind after witnessing too much wanton slaughter.

Before the Spellplague, Dambrath was a land of barbaric humans enslaved by the Crinti, a half-drow elite. During the Spellplague, the humans turned to emergent primal powers and lycanthropes that resembled their old tribal totems to drive out the Crinti. Today, shifters are common among Dambrath's nomadic tribes, sharing tents and horselines with their human cohorts. Shifters are thought to be blessed by Malar, bestial exarch of the Dambrathan's patron deity, Silvanus.
  You come from one of Dambrath's famous nomadic tribes. They say Dambrathans are born ahorse, and your skills with a mount lend proof to the adage. What is your tribe's totem?

  This loose collection of shifter tribes and lycanthropes has stalked the area formerly known as the Moonwood since long before the Spellplague.  Malar was their patron god, and they remain devoted to him as the exarch of Silvanus. Many of the smaller tribes, particularly those populated by wereboars and werewolves, still take captives and make sacrifices to Malar in bloody rites. Others have come to take a broader view, and while Beastlord worship forms the basis of their lives, there are times when their existence is not devoted to savagery. Growing up, you came to take pleasure in these moments, and eventually sought out the famed hospitality of Luruar in the hopes of learning more about another way of life. Your attempt did not go smoothly, and you found yourself rejected both by the People of the Black Blood and by the citizens of the city. Clearly, you had to forge your own path. </specific>

Your life began in Luskan's sewers, and for years you followed in the footsteps of the wererats and shifters that made up your extended "family." Nothing good came of this pitiful life of foulness and violence. In fact, things seemed to get worse every year. If your clan wasn't battling Shou pirates or running from undead, it was squabbling over the meager scraps left by the beggars and criminals Luskan calls citizens.
  You knew you had to get out, but it's never easy to leave home behind-especially when you're enmeshed in a criminal underworld. But a hard life has taught you hard lessons, and you shared what you learned with whomever got in your way. What was life like for you in Luskan? Did you live only in the sewers, or did you find shelter among the surface gangs? A Shou crime syndicate infiltrates the city's powerful-did you learn your trade from them? Perhaps you have some exotic skills gained through association with foreign pirates.  </specific>

Giants make dens in the island's mountains, and a few orc tribes scuff le in the peaks' shadows, but the Norlander villages huddle close to the island's coasts in fear of the Black Blood lycanthropes. This tribe was once connected to the People of the Black Blood, but Malar's demotion and the tribes' great physical separation led to division. Now, the terror of Moray's coastal villages comes to the rest of the Moonshaes, as the Black Blood's weres and shifters take longships on savage raids to the other islands.
  Your kind is hated and feared in the Moonshae Isles. How did you come to be on the continent? Perhaps you were shipwrecked and helped by someone ignorant of the dangers of Moray.

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Many Sembians focus on maintaining appearances. Others remain watchful for weakness or signs of anti-Netherese or anti-Shar sympathies, and Netheril keeps it own eyes upon the poppulace. In a land bursting with facade and falsehood, the nobles of Selgaunt have more reason to lie than most-for before the Spellplague, Selgaunt's blue blood acquired a lycanthropic taint. Rumor lays the fault at the feet of the ruling Uskevrens, but no noble mentions that suspicion aloud. One need only touch finger to nose and talk of "hot blood" to indicate that a noble son or daughter carries "the curse."
  Those "who can pass" are trained to suppress their instincts and take on their roles as idle socialites or merchant lords. Those who cannot meet varied fates. Some are accepted by their families but kept hidden from view. Others are cast out, fostered to those who owe favors or bargained to those who collect them. Which are you? Did you struggle to control your emotions amid finery and strict rules of etiquette, or did your foster parents put you to work as an agent in their trade? Were you forced to leave Sembia after your heritage was revealed, or were you sent on a trade mission to distant lands to get you out view of the Sembian public? </specific>

Your size made you the target of ridicule when you were young, and it was years before you fully understood what a boon it was. When you learned about Kord, something clicked. You had all the power needed—all you required was the will to use it. Controlling your strength, knowing when to use it and when words are enough, is something you had to learn in back alleys. Once you started standing up for yourself, it felt like an endless stream of bullies and toughs wanted to test your mettle.
     Do you still feel like you have something to prove? Do your adventures represent you taking on the other bullies in the world, or are they your attempts to face down internal demons from your past? Is being brave still something with which you struggle? Do you have any fears from a past you never conquered?</specific>

When the lightning slashes the sky and the waves toss the ship like a leaf on the wind, you like nothing better than to be at the prow, leaning out into the tempest like a living figurehead. Other sailors think you're crazed. On a ship your bravery cannot be doubted, but when the storms come, your sanity has been questioned. You've been lashed to the mast, and some have accused you of attracting Kord's wrath. You know the truth, though. On the sea you hear Kord the clearest, and in his storms you laugh along with him.
     Were you captain of a ship or just a crew member? On what kinds of vessels did you sail: merchant, military, or any boat that left port? Why don't you sail as often as you once did? Is there some danger in the sea you aren't facing? Do you seek something on land such as a treasure or special magic item?</specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> You were a weakling and a coward, bullied and intimidated by too many people to count. When you could, you avoided conflict with a glib tongue or by hiding. Then one day a thunderbolt struck you out of the blue sky. You awoke in the arms of friends who were awed that you survived. From that brilliant instant when your world turned to fire and pain, you have had your shock of white hair and your cloudy "storm eye." They serve as daily reminders of your survival despite a lightning bolt that seemingly singled you out. That you escaped death, perhaps death hurled by Kord, gave you courage. At first you lacked the strength to back up your bravery, but you persisted and endured the beatings, learning and becoming stronger until at last none would call you weakling or coward. You know now that if the lightning strike came from Kord, it was not his anger, but his blessing: a test that you passed with flying colors.
     Did you make any friends among those who once bullied you? Do any of the friends you had before the lightning strike resent the new you? Do you think the lightning strike was from Kord, or do you suspect a more mortal source? Does your storm eye have any special powers? </specific>

Thunder heralded your arrival in the world, and when you took your first breath, the tempest and battle fell eerily silent as the eye of the storm—Kord's eye—passed over you. Since then you were tutored and trained by warrior-scholars of Kord. For years, every moment of your waking hours was dedicated to preparing you for something: exercises, combat training, tactics and strategy, lessons about all the great conquerors, and the fighting techniques of a dozen nations. Then one day your teachers said you were ready; they had no more to teach you and you must seek to learn more in the wider world.
     Do you know for what your teachers were preparing you? Did they? Did your parents agree to give you over to the priests of Kord, or were you taken? What was the battle about when you were born? Do you believe yourself to be as important to Kord as those who taught you? </specific>

Perhaps you're inspired by great works of Nerathi literature or art, finding universal truths in their ancient expression. Maybe you marvel at the ruins of ancient Nerathi baths, forums, or roads, feeling that your homeland deserves the comforts enjoyed by your ancestors. Or maybe you're a student of the great philosopher Tallas, whose ethics guided the society which once ruled the world. Regardless of what you study, you're driven to bring this knowledge back to civilization. Be cautious though: the world's kings and nobles won't willingly surrender their authority.

Lady Tamora is fair but stern, sanctioning retaliation against fey incursions and doing her best to protect her people. Orlando is brave and honest, but he has shown no interest in rulership since his father died a decade ago. He has refused involvement in any action against the Sildane fey.
   Do you know the Tamora family well? What was your job in Crystalbrook before you answered Count Varis's call? What was your reputation beyond your known competence?

    <specific name="type" />
    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> You are driven by sheer curiosity. The desire to know is all that is needed for you to turn your faith to a dead deity. You are curious about when or how your deity died, but especially, why. Are gods as mortal as other beings? What happens with gods that die? How does it affect their faithful? You joined the faith of a dead deity out of a desire to know. Even as you go about fulfilling your deity's former goals, you never forget that the only reason you are in the faith is to learn.
	You are too curious for your own good. You have to know, even if it would be bad for you. You question the reason behind events and the reasons behind the reasons. You question faith—even your own. Despite that, you follow the edicts of your deity as best as you can, and you do so in the name of ‘research,' of course.
	How did you come to your knowledge? How did you find the dead faith you now follow? Did you have a mentor, or did you have to find out everything by yourself? How do your peers look at your studies? How far would you go to acquire knowledge? Is your interest in your dead deity really purely academic?
	Adventurers with this background enjoy seeking out old and forbidden places—temples by preference—hoping to uncover more knowledge. Quests for ancient relics or artifacts, or delves into uncharted territory, also appeal to them. The farther the better, though any quest that requires pouring over old and forbidden texts is worth the trouble. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> You are truly devoted, to the point that you actively seek to bring back to life the powers to which you pray. Returning a dead god to life is an epic adventure, and your initial aim is to gather power and lore to achieve it. Depending on your deity's nature and cause of death, you might seek alliances with other deities in a hope they will aid you in your quest.
	Why do you want to bring back this deity? Do you hope for a reward? Do you seek salvation? Do you see a need for that deity's return? How will you bring him or her back? Do you seek apotheosis or powerful necromantic rites? How do others feel about your quest, and how open are you about it? What do you intend to do if people oppose it?
	Most adventurers who follow this path are divine characters. Invokers, and especially devas, have a strong investment in a deity and might follow this path out of a sense of duty. Other races might be drawn to a deity's specific qualities and seek to bring it back as a patron to their race. Resurrectionists often fulfill a leading role. They are strong traditionalists, fighting to maintain and protect what they know and love. </specific>

    <specific name="type" />
    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Whether it is one god or all, you have turned against the powers of divinity. You feel the world does better without them. You found out that gods can—and do—die. You seek out dead gods to find out how gods die so you can rid the world of their presence forever. Dead gods also leak power, which you believe can be turned against the other faiths. You have found that hate and love are closely paired, and your quest against the gods is a belief as strong as that of any priest.
	Why do you hate the gods? Do you hate all of them, or only one? How deep does it go? How does the dead god whose power you seek relate to that hatred? How do you see others who worship gods? How do you make sure you can work with them? Do you pity them, or despise them for their foolishness? Do you fear death and the fate some tales spin for those who die faithless? How do you see the primordials? Are they beings better fit for worship, potential allies, or creatures as bad as or worse than the gods?
	Adventurers with this background seek out fellow adventurers with care. They avoid conflict by finding ways to accept divine characters, despite philosophical differences, even if it is only a temporary truce. As can be expected, god haters are rarely divine characters. Primal characters, as the world's wardens, have a great motivation to be god haters. However, some divine characters can become god haters after being disillusioned. Knowing the ways of the faith, these are perhaps the most fanatic and dangerous god haters. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Some people put faith in these powerful creatures that call themselves gods. You are more down to earth. Ever since learning that gods can die—that their corpses drift in the Astral Sea—you started to believe that they are much more powerful than you. That must change. To gain power, you need to take it. And while it is tricky to steal power from those that might fight back, how hard can it be to steal from those already dead?
	You desire power. Not wealth or arcane or martial might, but true divine power. You hope to steal it from a dead deity. You disguise your studies as worship and try to act devout—but you know it doesn't matter. You keep up a show to throw off suspicion, though people give you odd looks for clinging to an abandoned faith. Once you take the deity's power, the scorn you receive now will be worth it.
	Why do you choose this path to power? Why did you select the dead god you chose? Do you let your friends know your true motivations? What do you plan to do with the power once you gain it? How close is the connection between you and this deity? How far are you willing to go?
	Adventurers with this background often come from arcane traditions. Warlocks, especially vestige warlocks, have a natural inclination toward leeching power from others. Martially trained characters sometimes feel slighted at the apparent ‘ease' with which the divine obtain their powers, while they have to work hard to receive theirs. Leeches seek out adventures that promise quick gain for little effort, though they realize that, once in a while, they need to make an effort if they wish to achieve their goal. </specific>

Now, if they knew the truth, your teachers would probably brand you as dangerous.

Instead of pouring over dusty tomes or practicing with your blade, you tinkered with constructs of your own design or experimented with alchemical reagents. After completing your studies, you joined the military to seek excitement and test your skills. However, you quickly became disillusioned with a military dominated by haughty wizards and swordmages, and you left to pursue a career as an adventurer.
	Were you jealous of the advantages typically reserved for your wizard and swordmage peers? Did you wish to emulate them or did you defiantly pursue your own interests? How did your attitude affect your studies and subsequent career? What finally prompted you to leave the military? Did you leave of your own accord or in disgrace? </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> A small number of genasi philosophers do not subscribe to well-known psionics origin theories. Instead, they speculate that the essence of thought might have originated in the Elemental Chaos, manifesting in the material world like all other elemental power. By subscribing to this view, do you perceive psionics as a means of establishing closer ties to the surging chaos reflected by the natural world? Or do you embrace it as a kind of primal energy—endless and all-encompassing as it threads through every living thing? </specific>

	Your clan is outcast. It sees only one truth—one clear and narrow path. All your life, you learned that only one proper way exists and there is a right way to do everything, from waking in the morning to fetching water from the well. The labyrinth holds little meaning for your people. Why turn corners when your goal lies within sight?
	Your clan has no castes and no roles or declared leader. In it, all are equal as long as they adhere to the Narrow Way. In this philosophy, your clan has one god and adheres to that power's tenets alone.
	You've learned much about the weaker religions and the history of a world that does not know its path. As you head out into the world, you hope to steer others on the proper course. Of course, outside the strict life of your homeland, things get more complicated... </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Your clan traces its history back to the founding of the Labyrinth City of Leng. Thavok chose as his battleground the confusing volcanic landscape of canyons where Leng would be built, and his victory there over a force that outnumbered his a hundredfold would make the site hallowed ground for centuries. Members of your clan defended Leng for all those many years, building and using the labyrinth of tunnels, causeways, and paths to outmaneuver foes time and time again. Eventually, doom came to Leng, and your clan was powerless to stop it because the enemy was within and knew the labyrinth as well as any in the clan.
	Clan Thavok was betrayed. Wrongfully accused of treachery, your ancestors fled the city lest their blood soak the stones they had labored so long to protect. No member of your clan has looked upon the Labyrinth City's walls for generations, but it continues the old traditions. You have learned all the tricks of ambush and you possess knowledge of the hazards of dungeonscapes and tunnels. </specific>

By Sentune's way of thinking, experimentation and exploration should be at the root of every minotaur's life.
	Clan Sentune is thus a nomadic clan. Small groups and individuals wander separately for long periods only to gather for seasonal celebrations at spots decided upon at the previous celebration. Other minotaurs consider members of your clan permissive and idle vagabonds. In fact, many members of your clan become involved with strange gods or take up odd professions, and when the clan gathers you have the opportunity to discuss the choices individuals have made and to learn from others' successes and mistakes. </specific>

Indeed, Kranos gained infamy for his dread belt of crowns: a collection of the severed heads of leaders who sought to enslave or manipulate him.
	Your tribe stems from those Kranos fathered and those who sought to serve him while he lived. Yet Kranos kicked lapdogs away from him. If others followed him and his example, so be it, but Kranos would have no one lick his hooves clean. Thus, your clan accepts only those who can stand on their own and who have the will and strength to take what they want from life. You have leaders among your clan, but they earn their role by proving they are worth following. You might already be one of these leaders, or you might be seeking to prove your worth through adventure. </specific>

You might even have been stolen from your crib as an infant and taken to the Feywild. In this case, you must have been retrieved swiftly—those who spend too long in the Feywild develop beliefs and attitudes other than the Unseen Path—but still, an element of the experience stayed with you even to adulthood.
	You can choose to make this experience one of your character's backgrounds. While most characters with this background are rangers who are followers of the Unseen Path, you don't have to be. You could be anyone who experienced a childhood somehow influenced by the Path. </specific>

Like the other charlatans who worked for coppers, you told the aged of long years to come, the loveless of the romance they would find, and the paranoid of the dangers that lay ahead. It didn't seem like lying to tell people what they wanted to hear.

Things became complicated when your predictions started coming true. Business boomed, but soon you began telling people things they didn't like. You couldn't stop yourself from unveiling secrets and unmasking lies. Your newfound powers brought you more grief than gold, and eventually you fled and took up a new life as an adventurer. As you trained for battle and exploration, your powers of prescience faded, but your other psionic abilities increased. Thanks to them, you foresee a profitable future.

For whom did you read fortunes? What dire fates or dark secrets did you discover that might come back to haunt you? Does anyone seek revenge for a fortune you told? Do you still have visions of the future? Are they always clear and correct, or is much left to interpretation?

The ardent class makes the most sense with the feel of this background, but any class could work. Pick powers that emphasize prescience and acting before your enemies can react. The infernal eye paragon path might also suit you. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Everyone said the decaying castle was dangerous, but what better place for adolescents to play than an area where adults fear to tread? You and your friends tumbled about the tiefling ruins dozens of times before it happened. While wrestling with a playmate, the ground collapsed beneath you. You discovered a dungeon chamber filled with the remains of the dead. Your terrified friends ran away, never to return, but you didn't find the bones frightful. This event offered a chance to learn about your heritage firsthand.

You came back to the ruin again and again, often exploring its secrets for days at a time. One day, you found something special: a crystal imprinted with visions of the past, including the teachings of a tiefling
psion. This crystal awakened not only your latent psionic talent, but also a burning hunger to learn more of the past.

Where were the ruins in which you played? Did you unearth other secrets, perhaps dangerous ones? Did you meet any creatures in the dungeons below the ruins? What memories did the crystal contain? Do you still have it? Who was the tiefling psion? What happened to your childhood friends? What do you seek to discover from the visions in the crystal—the lost psionic techniques of the ancient tieflings, untold secrets of tiefling history, or something else entirely?

This background works as well for self-taught ardents and battleminds as for monks and psions; perhaps you sought tutelage after your contact with the memory crystal. Work with your DM to establish the details of the ruin and the memory crystal. The crystal and your quest for knowledge can become major plot points or simply remain background material, depending on your inclination. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Your parents recognized your natural talents before you could walk. Some called your unusual powers a curse, but your parents viewed them as a gift and did what they could to help you develop your psychic abilities. Ultimately, however, they knew there was too much they could not teach you.

When you were old enough to head out into the world on your own, your parents sent you to learn psionic mastery at an academy run by strict disciplinarians. While taking classes to harden your mind and heart, you learned about how your psionic power marked you as destined to rule. From birth, they said, you were better than those around you. This idea fit well with the stories you heard as a child about how tieflings would one day resurrect Bael Turath and rule once again.

For a while, you thought you might help start that rebirth, but your better judgment saved you from life as an evil despot. One night you fled your cruel masters and stole out into the darkness, never to return. It was a betrayal of the school and your parents' wishes, but loyalty to your conscience outweighed these other desires.

Did your parents know about the unethical teachings of your school? Did they deliver you freely, or did some greater power mandate your attendance. Did your parents earn some reward for handing you over to the psionic school? Were you a star student or a troublemaker? What did your teachers plan for your future? What do your parents think of your departure from the school? Do agents of the school seek you out, fearing what you might do with what you learned there?

This background works well for a psion or monk because both classes assume a character takes some training to learn the rudiments of the class's powers. Even so, an ardent or battlemind could work with this background as well, with evil teachers manipulating their students' emotions or drilling them in dirty fighting. Regardless of class, you might choose a feat that represents your educational experience, such as Jack of All Trades or Skill Training. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> You didn't ask for this. You were perfectly happy with your life in the city. Well, maybe not happy exactly; you survived as a crook, a scam artist. One day, a scheme for putting silver in your pocket hit a snag, and you felt it prudent to leave town for a while.

That's when the spirit spoke to you.

While resting near a natural spring in the forest, you heard its voice in your heart and mind. It had chosen you, it said. The forest needed a champion, and it was your destiny to help. You tried many times to worm out of this obligation, but each time your mind returned to the beauty of the glade and the warmth of the voice. You wonder, if you'd chosen a different path through the woods, would the spirit have chosen the next traveler as its champion.

How connected are you to your former life? How long ago did you leave it behind? How does being caught between two worlds affect you? Do you still regret the spirit's selection of you as its champion? How does this reluctance manifest itself in your attitude toward the spirits? What was the spirit who taught you primal magic? What danger brought you to the forest's defense, and how does it still threaten the world?

You can also represent your internal conflict between the civilized and primal world with a mix of skill choices (Nature and Streetwise make good opposing skills). Consider using multiclass feats or even hybrid character rules to build a character torn between the primal spirits and another path. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> In the dark age after the falls of Bael Turath and Arkhosia, tieflings spread throughout the ruined settlements of the post-apocalyptic chaos. Many tieflings survived by clinging to the guttering lights of civilization, but others plunged with their human cousins into the darkness of a world gone savage. Wild tribes of humanity carved out places for themselves in the untamed wilderness and lost all contact with their civilized history.

Your people, the proud nomads of the Chimera tribe, come from such stock. They see your strange physical features as gifts from your tribe's totem beast. Your horns are those of the ram. Your tail and resistance to fire come from its dragon soul. Finally, your bloodlust is born of the lion's heart.

How did you learn the truth of your tiefling heritage? How did it change your self-image? Do you still hold the chimera as your totem? How were you treated in your tribe? Did you belong to a bloodline of leadership? Did you leave your tribe or were you forced away? Do you seek to return to them or do they seek you?

This is a great background for a tiefling of any primal class. As a barbarian you might ascribe your strength and rage to the chimera. As a druid, you could use wild shape to assume ram or lion form. If you play a shaman, your spirit companion might look like a small chimera. A tiefling seeker might desire a flying chimera mount from which to rain down attacks. And as a warden you should of course aspire to attain the 29th-level power, form of the chimera. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> After the fall of Bael Turath, some tieflings retained power, ruling over isolated baronies and duchies throughout the remains of the empire. Your family ruled one such fiefdom; in truth little more than a sturdy tower and surrounding village, but a mark of pride nonetheless.

When you returned home after a long diplomatic mission, you found the tower cast to rubble and everyone dead. Only scattered tracks and the arrows left in the bodies of the fallen gave any clue to the horrors that had occurred. Your royal escort fled to a neighboring kingdom to beg for shelter, but you couldn't let the trail go cold for fear that the murderers responsible might go unpunished.

What do you remember of your royal history? Do you seek to reclaim your ruined kingdom? Who destroyed all that you knew? How will you mete out vengeance when you find these villains? Or does something prevent you from gaining your revenge?

Any martial class can work with this background. Decide whether you learned this class's talents before or after your kingdom fell; rogue and warlord fit well with a royal background, while fighter or ranger might make the most sense for a loner hell-bent on revenge. Consider mixing contrasting character elements that represent both your royal life and your new, harder existence, such as the Jack of All Trades and Lethal Hunter feats. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> You grew up in a circus called Nightrule's Carnival Cavalcade. Its eerie chime-and-calliope music drifted miles ahead of the approaching caravan, promising sinister secrets and devilish delights that drew folk from miles around. Enchanted beasts, gifted performers, wild entertainments, and amusing games spilled out across open fields or city squares. The Carnival Cavalcade bewitched visitors with its frights and pleasures. Nightrule, the uncannily charismatic tiefling leader of the circus, took you in and made you one of his star performers. Your wild life in the circus brought you many joys and taught you a great deal about the world, but even the most happy dream can become a nightmare.

How old were you when you joined the circus? Did you join it willingly, or did it somehow claim you? Strong man, knife thrower, juggler, acrobat, jester, freak—which were you? Did you perform in more than one role, perhaps adopting a new costume for each? Do you still display some remnant of your past, or do you conceal your time under Nightrule's sway? What sinister secrets did Nightrule's Carnival Cavalcade conceal from the public? Why did you leave? Did you leave anyone you care for behind?

Give some thought to your role in the circus and take feats and other character elements that reinforce that role. An acrobat might take Long Jumper and Sure Climber. As an escape artist, you might be trained in Acrobatics and Thievery and take the Escape Artist feat. A knife thrower might have Far Throw and Quick Draw. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Mercenary isn't quite the right word. It sounds too formal, too militaristic. No, you worked for a living, and as ugly as that work got, it put food on the table and coins in your purse. Your life as a hired sword wasn't easy—and you have the scars to prove it—yet those who crossed you always got the worse end of the bargain.

Why was fighting for money the best way to make a living? Are you still for hire? Did your work earn you a reputation, and is it one you welcome or regret? What kinds of jobs did you take—pushing around merchants, shadowy bodyguard work for a spoiled noble, or something much worse? Were there jobs you wouldn't take? Does anyone still owe you pay? Did you make any enemies while working for others' interests?

Sellsword is a good background for fighters and warlords, but as a ranger or rogue your employment might have put you in more secretive roles. Perhaps instead of a soldier you were a scout, or rather than an armed guard you acted as a plainclothes bodyguard.

Consider feats that emphasize your history as someone who lived by the blade. Nimble Blade, Quick Draw, and Toughness might be good choices. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> You grew up on the streets, living on the wrong side of the law. One day something inside you changed, and you vowed not to live simply as one of the scum who scuttled through the alleys and sewers of the city. You clawed your way up through the ranks of the underworld until you led your own gang of thieves...at least for a time.

What set you on the path to becoming a gang leader, and what caused you to stop? Did something scare you straight? Did your gang commit crimes against the wicked and greedy, or were you less discriminating? Did your gang rely on simple burglary, or did you prefer more brutal tactics? What happened to your gang when you left? Do your former allies still respect you and can you rely on them for aid, or are you a pariah? Are you still wanted by some authority? Do your friends know about your past?

The cutthroat rogue or trickster rogue builds make good choices for this background, and the guildmaster thief is an obvious paragon path choice. As a warlord, you can use this background to explain how your character learned leadership skills. Consider the archer warlord build, perhaps even training in Stealth to use cover to hide and gain combat advantage. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Many tieflings grow up knowing only a handful of their own kind. You weren't so fortunate.

Your life began in Bael Hexott, a colony of hundreds of tieflings hidden in the ruined castle of a powerful cleric from the age of Bael Turath. The leaders of your colony claimed kinship to this ancient leader, showing as proof their ability to pass through the castle's magically warded gates. Like the cleric of old, the tieflings of Bael Hexott worship Asmodeus. Outsiders who discovered the secret colony inevitably became sacrifices in its fiery halls.

Yet you never felt any passion for their doctrines of tyranny and domination. The more you rebelled against the temptations of Asmodeus, the more clearly you heard another god's call. You concealed your faith, but in time your devotions could stay secret no longer. You escaped Bael Hexott, hoping never to return.

Which deity called out to you in the dark? Do the tieflings of Bael Hexott seek to silence you? Do any relatives or friends remain behind? Might they also be tempted toward a path of light?

Having come from a place of tyranny and evil, you might follow a deity of freedom or goodness, such as Pelor and Avandra. On the other hand, perhaps Kord gave you the strength to rebel, or Sehanine helped you hide your faith.

When picking powers for your character, consider taking those that help others gain the freedom you desired for yourself, such as powers that grant saving throws. Also, consider how your fiery home might have affected you: perhaps you avoid fire powers in preference to radiant powers. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Too often tieflings wander without purpose. They seek something in the world that they cannot find within themselves, or they try to run from what they learn when they gaze deep into their souls.

Not so with you. You've known all your life why you were born and for what purpose you continue to draw breath. You are heaven's weapon, a prophesied embodiment of the gods' desire to bring Asmodeus to heel. You might not personally strike the final blow against the gates of hell, but you are somehow the key. If you fail in your purpose, another soul like yours might not be born for a thousand years.

What makes your soul special? Did the gods change it somehow or are you related to some god in a deeper way than most? Are you destined to battle Asmodeus, to imprison the devils more firmly in the Nine Hells, or to prevent a more immediate danger? Do all the gods but Asmodeus favor your fate, or might some have reason to continue dealing with the devils for another thousand years?

A protecting or virtuous paladin makes a great choice for this background. Give some thought to the deity your character favors. You might be a generalist who worships the whole pantheon and opposes the god's enemies, or you might function as the secret weapon of a particular deity with an axe to grind with Asmodeus. If your DM allows, you might even serve an evil deity. Even the vilest god might have good reason to see the infernal forces defeated. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> An unwanted child rarely finds safe haven in the world, and an unwanted tiefling baby fares even worse. Many are left to die in the wilderness, prey to beasts, exposure, or starvation. Few would praise such an act of cruelty, but fewer still would agree to take in an orphan tiefling.

You were lucky—if being left to die can ever be called lucky. A wandering priest found you. Despite the ill omens and your cursed form, the cleric took you in. Despite this softhearted moment, you would not call your benefactor kind—firm, proud, faithful, righteous, but not kind. You learned much under his tutelage and from those with whom he shared his secret student. When you were strong enough to make your own way, he set you out into the world as friendless as he found you.

What kind of a person was your teacher? What omens did he see, and why did he ignore them? Why did your religious training not occur in a more structured setting? Did you learn beliefs or practices different from mainstream worshipers? Why did he keep your existence a secret? Do you want to learn the identities of your parents? Why did they abandon you? Has your hard life made you strong? Are you distant from others or do you seek out companionship?

The avenger class works particularly well with this background, but any divine character could have his or her origin to a trainer in the wilderness. Melora makes perfect sense for your deity, but so might Avandra or Kord. Perhaps those who found you were elves and they taught you worship of Corellon. If non-humans found you, it might help to explain why your upbringing was so strict and secretive. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Some tieflings think of the ancient story of their race's origin as a fairytale or as events so long past that they have no effect on the world today. But you know better. The oaths sworn by your ancestors still bind your soul to a hellish fate in the afterlife. The powers that liberated so many tieflings neglected to free your line. You know this not just because a devil told you so but because you feel it in your bones. Diabolic power flows through your blood and surges with every spell you cast. Infernal creatures know you by face and name, and they tempt you with power. If you do as they wish, they'll give you what you want in this world. Yet you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.

What kinds of devils have contacted you? Do you have a relationship with any particular fiend? What do they want from you? Do you sometimes do as the devils ask, figuring that you might as well enjoy the gifts they've given you? Or do you use your hell-wrought spells to fight the devils or even to free yourself from their power?

A warlock with the infernal pact makes an excellent choice for this background, but other classes have suitably hellish powers that suit this character history. The swordmage has powers such as inferno's sword and hell's own blade. The sorcerer and wizard classes have plenty of fiery powers that could have infernal ties. Bard presents relatively few powers that are obviously appropriate, but as with any arcane class, you could link a power to hell by describing it in a thematic way. The song of discord, for example, might set tiny devils to playing discordant music as they whirl about the dominated victim's head. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Portents presaged your birth, and arcane forces gathered to welcome you into the world. You are the prophesied one. Your greatness as a spellcaster has been long foreseen, but the mystics disagree on how you will use that power.

Most say you are destined to bring darkness to the world. A few perceive a path of light in your future. Far too many from both sides seek to wrest away your destiny, setting you upon a path of their choosing. But it's your life, and these are your choices to make. Who are they to tell you how you will live and what you will do?

You look to the stars, and they seem to speak to you. You've known each constellation and star by name for as long as you can remember. And whenever you have a difficult decision, the darkness between their celestial lights seems to hold the answer.

What groups prophesied your birth? What do they think you will do with your power? Have others learned of the prophecy, and how do they seek to use you? Have any of the prophecies come true, perhaps in some twisted way? Do you balk at your dark destiny, or do you seek to accomplish a great deed foretold by mysterious figures? What did you parents know of these omens and portents? Do you have siblings who might support you or envy your potential?

A warlock with the star pact makes sense for this background. Regardless, picking powers and feats that feel like they change fate or luck will emphasize your character's history. Fortune's reversal is a great choice for a beginning warlock. At higher levels, you can reinforce your background with choices such as dark one's own luck if you're a warlock or fate's chaos if you're playing a sorcerer. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Others might have learned their magic in stuffy schools or from learned masters, but you're self-taught. Always prone to curiosity more than common sense, you poked about in places others considered dangerous and delved into locations thought to be deadly. In one such exploration you found a strange book, and since no one seemed to be using it at the moment, you stole it. It took a while to puzzle out its strange symbols and odd language, but your patience was rewarded with the casting of your first spell. Now you're a self-made master of the arts, but the curiosity that drove you into arcane magic drives you still. You're always curious about new magic and strange devices—especially when no one is looking.

Where did you get your first taste of arcane knowledge? What was the book and do you still have it? Who owned the book before? Are they still looking for the scoundrel who stole it? Were you a thief before you took the book, or did this one indiscretion lead you down the path of burglary?

Warlocks and wizards make the most sense as rogue scholars. A wizard might find a spellbook, and a warlock might discover the means of contacting some otherworldly power. Other classes can make sense as well. For example, the techniques of a swordmage
might be written down as a kind of training manual. Work with your Dungeon Master to detail the nature of the book you pilfered and from whom you took it. Maybe it holds secrets you still struggle to decipher. </specific>

You have an affinity for those spirits—primal beings that don't take human or animal shape, but roar in the wind and pulse in the harsh light of the sun. Because of that affinity, you were the protector of your people, able to summon those spirits with a word to scour your enemies from the earth in a terrible storm.

But now you are cut off from those spirits and from the people you used to defend. Why did you leave? Perhaps you failed in your duty, and you have no clan left to protect. Perhaps the spirits of storm and sun summoned you from your home in pursuit of a larger purpose. Or you might simply have grown tired of your responsibility and become curious about the world beyond your clan's lands.

Without the spirits of your native land, your primal magic is not as strong, but neither is it entirely absent. Other spirits of weather and the land respond to your call, just more slowly. With time, perhaps, you will learn to control the mightiest forces of nature wherever your travels take you. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> For all their elemental power and keen intellect, dragons are creatures of the natural world as much as bears and panthers, and some of the myriad primal spirits that inhabit the world appear as dragons. Some dragonborn clans, particularly those that lived on the fringes of ancient Arkhosia or were never incorporated into the empire, long ago replaced an actual dragon patron with a primal spirit in dragon form. Your clan followed this ancient tradition, and you learned your primal magic in communion with this dragon spirit.

Is your dragon totem a benevolent patron, or a terrible force of nature that must be appeased to prevent catastrophe? You might be the shaman who was supposed to keep it appeased, but who failed in that duty with disastrous consequences. Or you might have been a barbarian thane who channeled the dragon totem's power to lead your clan before some circumstance separated you from your people.

This background element works for any primal class. You might want to choose powers that reflect your dragon totem, or change the flavor of the powers you select to give them a draconic edge. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> From the moment you emerged from your egg, it's been clear that you were chosen to be the mouthpiece of a primal drake spirit. It might be a furious spirit that has fueled a powerful inner rage in you for your whole life, or a loyal guard drake spirit that chose you to protect your family or clan. Or it could be something more akin to a fang titan drake, a beast of tremendous power that wants you for some great purpose that you're not yet aware of or prepared for.

What manifestation of the spirit drake at your birth made the spirit's choice clear to those around you? Perhaps it sent a living drake to brood your egg. Maybe you erupted with fury as you hatched, hurling the fragments of your shell around the room. How were you raised in accordance with the drake spirit's wishes? Were you segregated from other children as a mark of your special calling? Did you grow up in the wilderness with the drake that hatched your egg? Or did your parent simply watch you carefully but otherwise allow you to lead a normal childhood?

This is a particularly appropriate background for a dragonborn shaman—your spirit companion can be the spirit drake who chose you. However, it works equally well for any other primal class, with a less direct relationship to that drake spirit. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> The totem ragers of ancient Arkhosia were an elite warrior order that practiced primal traditions to become more ferocious in battle. The order was shattered before the fall of Arkhosia, after being infiltrated and corrupted by infernal spies loyal to Bael Turath. The imperial priests of Erathis declared the totem ragers to be in league with devils and the empire's enemies, and the order was officially disbanded and outlawed. It survived only in small groups that continued to meet in secret.

In this form, the totem ragers survived the fall of the empire, and you are one of its few, scattered heirs. This tradition has long outlasted the imperial authority that declared it outlaw, so there is little need for secrecy—but the scattered members of your order have practiced secrecy for so long that it is a well-ingrained habit. What's more, your primal connections are still greeted with suspicion by the clergy of the Imperial Arkhosian temples, though they lack any legal recourse to prosecute you.

Most Arkhosian totem rager characters are barbarians. You might choose to focus on daily rage attack powers that evoke draconic spirits, from rage drake's frenzy at 1st level to blue dragon rage at 25th. If you can't find an appropriate rage power at a given level, consider renaming and reflavoring an existing power, so frost wolf rage at 5th level might become white dragon rage in your hands. You might also choose this background element as a warden, applying some of the same cosmetic changes to your daily guardian form powers. </specific>

What has changed to bring you closer to civilization and into a party of adventurers? Did a new population of monsters make your wilderness home suddenly inhospitable?

Your passion rubs off on your allies, making you something of a leader figure even if that's not your combat role in game terms. It's hard not to follow where you lead, simply because you go there with such enthusiasm and commitment.

What stirs your passion for adventuring? Is it a lust for glory, a thirst for gold, or a crusading hatred of monstrous evil? Or is it simply the thrill of being out in the world, rootless and free, risking your life every day in
bloody battle? 

Are you a warlord who gets your allies worked into a frenzy to improve their fighting ability? A rogue whose fervor in battle leaves your enemies off guard? A fighter who leads by example, expecting that your passion itself is contagious?

You hone your body and train constantly with your chosen weapon or weapons. It's more than a matter of survival—it's about your own growth, your honor, and the reputation of your clan. You might focus on discipline and order so intently that you find it hard to be flexible in changing circumstances. On the other hand, that sort of flexibility might be an important part of your training, preparing to expect the unexpected and respond to what you can't be prepared for.

Perhaps this relentless focus on discipline has its roots in a traumatic past event. Did your lack of discipline lead to a loved one's death? Or did you develop a rigid sense of order as a result of a chaotic youth, an
utter lack of stability around you? Perhaps it's simply the result of strict training in the ancient martial traditions of your race. Did you study swordplay surrounded by icons of Arkhosia's glory, learning that someday you would march in an army bent on restoring the empire?

This is a fine background element for a dragonborn fighter, but it works for any martial character.

Perhaps it was safeguarded by an angel, awaiting the proper time for it to come to light in a great mortal champion. Or it might have been claimed by a dragonborn invoker who passed it down through countless centuries, until your dying master passed it on to you. Perhaps it has been hidden in your bloodline, passed through generations, and perhaps it remains dormant until you manage to awaken it fully. Whatever the case, you are the custodian of tremendous divine power—power that many others would dearly love to claim.

This is a great background for an invoker who isn't just a student of the ancient ways, but a literal heir of ancient power. Consider working toward the Avatar of Io epic destiny (see page 32), but every divine power you use throughout your career is a manifestation of Io's spark in you. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Your divine powers come from Tiamat, but it hardly seems fair to say you worship the evil god of greed and vengeance. You might fear her, certainly, and even respect her power—but if it were up to you, you'd rather forsake the power she's given you than actually carry out her will. Perhaps you trained as an avenger to hunt down Tiamat's enemies, but some event awakened your long-dormant conscience and spurred you to flee her temple's service. You might even have been kidnapped, magically controlled, and indoctrinated into her secret cult, then freed—but left to sort out the jumble of your thoughts and allegiances on your own.

Playing an evil character can easily become disruptive at the game table, but playing a character who is struggling against strong evil tendencies can be rich with roleplaying opportunities. Choose powers that emphasize the sinister nature of the deity who grants them to you, so that even your fellow adventurers are a bit scared of what you might do. But look for ways for your character to someday break free of Tiamat's grasp, even if it's in a final act of self-sacrifice. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Though you worship a recognizable deity of the traditional pantheon, you do so in a way that most would consider strange or even abhorrent. Your beliefs about the gods and the proper ways to serve them are unconventional, to say the least. You might have learned them in a monastery (making this a particularly appropriate background element for avengers) or come up with them on your own, perhaps in reaction against more traditional teachings that were instilled in you earlier in life. You might, for example, worship Melora as the great catastrophic dragon of the ocean depths, the third and mightiest spawn of Io. Or you might revere Tiamat as an unaligned deity of fair retribution, twisting the traditional understanding of her thirst for vengeance into a quality that is at least palatable, if not admirable. Perhaps you believe that all the deities are actually dragons ascended to godhood who are simply exemplars who show mortals the path to the same ascension.

Since being unconventional defines much of your character, look for other ways you can defy expectations in your character choices. Don't make choices that prevent you from fulfilling your role, but anything else is fair game. An unexpected multiclass feat (a lawful good paladin with the Pact Initiate feat who dabbles in infernal warlock powers), or atypical weapon and armor choices (an avenger who disdains stealth and wears heavy armor) can go a long way toward making your character seem unorthodox—and interesting. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> In ancient Arkhosia, a society of bards, wizards, and sorcerers called the Order of the Ninefold Path codified and propagated the arcane teachings of the dragonborn. The sages of this order lived as mendicants, owning nothing but the tomes they could carry and relying on the support and hospitality of the citizenry as they traveled from city to city. They traveled in pairs, one master and one student. As the student's knowledge grew to equal the master's, they would seek out new students in the cities they visited, thus passing on the secrets of the order. A few scattered masters of the Ninefold Path remain in the wake of Arkhosia's fall, but students willing to accept their tutelage are few and far between. You have studied with a master of the order, learning ancient arcane teachings unfamiliar to current-age practitioners of magic. What happened to the master who taught you? Are you looking for a student, or did your master die or disappear before your training was complete, leaving you in search of a new master?

You might use a feat choice, such as Draconic Spellcaster or Curse of Io's Blood (both from Arcane Power), to reflect your unusual arcane training. Also consider the Ninefold Master paragon path. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> You learned the practice of magic from an actual dragon. It's rare for dragons to cast spells as mortals do, but magic is in their blood, and some sagacious dragons instruct mortals—particularly dragonborn—in truly ancient methods of spellcasting. Most commonly, their students are bound to them as slaves, and their magic is meant to be used in the dragon's service. You were such a slave, learning draconic spellcasting at the side of an exceptionally wise, old, and learned dragon. How did you escape your servitude? Was the dragon killed by adventurers, or by a more powerful monster—perhaps a rival dragon? Did its arcane research lead to its demise or disappearance? What do you plan to do with your newfound freedom? How will you use the magic you learned from your former master?

This is a great background for a dragonborn warlock, since you can put a draconic spin on any pact you choose. Your dragon master might have been a fey dragon of great and mysterious power, an infernal dragon infused with hellfire, or a student of the stars. Alternatively, your sorcerer spells could be a manifestation of the dragon's power in you (if you practice Dragon Magic), or you might have studied Cosmic Magic at your master's side. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Arcane power is in your nature, part and parcel of the same elemental forces that power your dragon breath. Casting spells feels no different for you from exhaling draconic power—they are just as natural. For many dragon-blooded spellcasters, controlling the magic that seems always eager to burst forth is extremely difficult. You might be prone to magical mishaps, especially with at-will powers that burst forth without any real thought or effort on your part. On the other hand, mastery of your powers might be as natural to you as regulating your breathing, a simple matter of directing your will and energy outward and creating the magical manifestation you desire. In either case, those who study and train for years to master the merest scraps of magical power look upon you with envy or perhaps fear, for power comes readily to your hand, for good or for ill. You feel a kinship and affinity for dragons, and you might dream of one day transforming yourself into that pinnacle of the draconic form—or of subjugating dragons to your will.

Most dragon-blooded spellcasters are sorcerers who practice Dragon Magic or bards who extol the Virtue of Valor. Dragon-blooded bards lift up dragons as the exemplars of valor, and many of their spells take on draconic characteristics. For example, your shout of triumph might be a draconic roar that creates a brief image of a dragon around or above you to strike terror in your enemies' hearts, while your song of storms might make you appear as a blue dragon while the effect persists. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Many dragonborn earn a living selling their services as mercenaries, caravan guards, or bodyguards. While their imposing physical size and strength make dragonborn fighters and warlords well suited to such work, many dragonborn of an arcane bent follow similar careers, putting their magic to violent purpose. The life of a mercenary leads quite naturally into a career as an adventurer—all it takes is one job gone horribly wrong, one unexpected encounter with a threat beyond the normal caravan raiders or enemy soldiers, to change a mercenary's life forever.

You might be a swordmage who fits in easily among more martially inclined sellswords, or a wizard or sorcerer who provides arcane artillery support to a band of more traditional soldiers. Or as a bard, you might serve as the leader of a mercenary company, fighting alongside your fellow soldiers while encouraging and uplifting them with your magic. Even if you're not normally inclined to melee, you might consider picking up proficiency with a good melee weapon or even multiclassing into fighter or warlord to reflect your military background. </specific>

This brooding forest has never felt the bite of an axe or the flame's hungry touch, for the woodland defends itself. One does not live in the Wrathwood without the permission of the trees; even the animals and insects sheltering beneath the boughs show deep reverence for their homeland. The Wrathwood does not welcome sentient beings, but those who show deference to and respect for the trees are tolerated and might even be allowed to make their homes in the cool shadows cast by towering redwoods.
You have a special connection to the Wrathwood and carry the lessons of your homeland with you as you venture into the world. Elves, eladrin, gnomes, and other races with strong connections to nature hail from this homeland. Any primal class can originate in the Wrathwood, though druids are the most common. </specific>

Certain places, far from the frequently traveled corridors, are filled with eddies and swirls of primal power, spawning new life out of the ruins of old. Such places are called the Underwild, and in them fungus forests, sweeps of phosphorescent mold, and slime pools gather primal energy for use by those who have the courage to seize it. Those who discover the Underwild also find abundant food, water, and other resources to help them survive the otherwise desolate Underdark.
Originating from the Underdark, you have seen its wonders and its wickedness. Drow is the best racial choice for this homeland, and the dark elves make interesting barbarians and druids. Of course, any race that has strong ties to the Underdark can work as well. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Sarifal's borders encompass the large isle of Gwynneth, once home to the human realm of Corwell. Those longtime settlers of the isle, the Ffolk, were largely driven from these lands a century ago when fey began immigrating en mass. Within a few short years, the lost city of Karador rose from the depths of Myrloch and the ancient kingdom of Sarifal was born anew. Since that time Sarifal has expanded beyond Myrloch Vale to encompass the whole of the isle, the glimmering shallows along the coast, and the lightless caverns below.
Outsiders see Sarifal as a sylvan paradise governed by a strong yet enigmatic leader—an image the ruling matriarch works hard to cultivate. Those born to the region, however, know that life within Sarifal is a delicate chess match between several powers, capricious archfey, depraved fomorians, spirit lords, and more. So far the High Lady and the few remaining of her kind have been able to maintain the delicate balance of power. But for how long? </specific>

    <specific name="type"> Geography </specific>
    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> South of Khorvaire, beyond the Thunder Sea, Xen'drik rises from the waves, beckoning to sage and explorer, merchant and adventurer. Deep in jungles thick with foul creatures, the ivy-covered cyclopean ruins from the empire of giants still stand, their great secrets waiting to be revealed and their fabulous magical treasures waiting to be unearthed. Vast deserts stretch out like cupped hands to catch the dragon shards that fall to Eberron from the Ring of Siberys, and great mountains hide winding tunnels and vast chasms that shelter the tribes of the scorpion-worshiping drow.
Cartographers take incredible risks to create accurate maps of Xen'drik, but no modern explorer has successfully mapped the heart of the Continent of Mysteries. Giants, the descendants of ancient empires, make their homes across the continent, worshiping strange, arcane powers or violent primal spirits. Relics and ruins of a past demonic age occasionally birth horrors far worse than giants.
Yet for all its dangers, Xen'drik attracts the interest of many of Khorvaire's inhabitants, particularly the dragon marked houses. Many of Eberron's people—including elves and warforged—can trace their lineage to this forgotten land, and they seek to fill in the gaps of their own history. The riches of the giants' empire wait for explorers, as do the vast fields of dragon shards. The jungle lands are verdant, and if they could be tamed, they would offer grand opportunities for farming and settlement.
Only a small number of settlements established by foreigners have survived on Xen'drik. Most are tiny frontier towns, maintained by a rich patron or a dragon marked house. The famous port of Stormreach is the only one of them that has managed to become a full-fledged city. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> It is a realm without hope, without sanity, without light—but not without life. Endless darkness, crushing rock, winding corridors, and sunless seas fill the vastness beneath the surface of Eberron. This realm is Khyber, the Dragon Below, an Underdark world that lurk likes a ravenous maw beneath the feet of surface dwellers.
Khyber is a realm of nightmare. Demons that stalked Eberron a thousand generations ago lie imprisoned within its depths, and beings of madness slither through its twisted passageways. Foulspawn and other aberrant creatures lurk in Khyber, orchestrating plans to unleash destruction and madness upon Eberron.
The passageways to Khyber are few, although rumors and ancient texts tell of gaping pits on the face of Eberron that lead into its depths. Despite Khyber's horrors, many surface dwellers have an unhealthy fascination with the denizens of the Dragon Below. Khyber cultists grant their devotion and their sanity to the foul beings that dwell in the Underdark, hatching vile plots to empower the objects of their worship through sacrifices of blood; they even conspire to loose these creatures upon Eberron's other inhabitants.
A few individuals brave Khyber's depths in search of fortune or to destroy the evil that dwells there. Treasure hunters seek valuable midnight blue and oily black Khyber dragon shards, obtainable only in the darkest depths. Adventurers strive to destroy ancient beings of evil, for the good of all or in order to ensure their place in the legends of ages to come. </specific>

With its ancient treasures and untouched lands, the Frostfell beckons to adventurers and explorers like a gleaming, uncut jewel. For all the attempted expeditions to the Frostfell, little is known of this enigmatic region. Few groups have returned safely from exploration of the region. One such group is the Wayfinder Foundation, an organization of exploration and philanthropy led by the half ling Boroman ir'Dayne. The foundation's members have reported great devil-ruled cities in the ice, towers of frozen bone, and warm oases in the midst of frosty vales. However, most of their accounts are contradictory. The dwarven clans of the Mror Holds believe that they originally hail from the Frostfell. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> The name Argonnessen brings a shudder to even the bravest explorers, for it is a land of mystery and fear. Vicious tides and murderous rocks surround it, and fierce barbarian tribes inhabit its shores. Yet much greater perils lie beyond its beaches. 
Argonnessen is the ancestral home of Eberron's dragons, which guard the land's legendary wonders. Ancient cities, enormous structures, and vast treasures lie within Argonnessen. A few explorers, adventurers, scholars, and  merchants have braved the Dragonreach to land on the beaches of Seren Island or upon the coast of Argonnessen. If anyone has ever traveled beyond these lands' borders, though, they have left no evidence of their discoveries.
The only region of Argonnessen known to outsiders is Totem Beach, where most ships make landfall. Huge stone monuments, built by unknown powers in a bygone age, jut from the sands, looking out over the sea. Beyond, a thick jungle and the Great Barrier Mountains block any view of the continent's interior.
Sailors from the Lhazaar Principalities clash frequently with the barbarians of Seren, who attempt to raid passing ships. Most Seren barbarians are human, but a few dragon born tribes exist as well. Most dragon born believe that Argonnessen is their ancestral home, but the dragon born of Q'barra came to Khorvaire so long ago that they have no better knowledge of Argonnessen than anyone else. </specific>

The raiders also struck coastal settlements, small towns, and anyone and anything they wanted, flaunting their power and savagery in the faces of the nations that bore the brunt of their attacks.
	If there was one boon from the horrors of the Spellplague, it was the sea swells that washed away much of the pirates' presence from the isles.

	In 1374 DR, the sun elf lord Seiveril Miritar destroyed the invading daemonfey (demonic elves) and recaptured the ruins of Myth Drannor, at the cost of his life. His daughter, Ilsevele Miritar, took up leadership over the elven army. With her assistance, the high mage Araevin Teshurr sealed the portals of the city and repaired the mythal that had long lay damaged. Ilsevele Miritar assumed the long-lost title of coronal and reestablished Myth Drannor as an elven kingdom.
	Myth Drannor claims sovereignty over the ancient woodland of Cormanthor, from the shores of Lake Sember to the River Lis. However, its people are few in number, and wide stretches of the land under the coronal's authority are empty wilderness. Many parts of the forest are still quite dangerous: monster-filled elven ruins dating back centuries, haunted manors and strongholds raised by long-forgotten human lords, and hidden caverns leading deep into the Underdark. The old kingdom of Myth Drannor was a bastion of goodness and might that kept the entire region safe, but the new Myth Drannor must rely on diplomacy, arcane lore, stealth, and vigilant scouts to protect its own borders.
	The folk of Myth Drannor have forged strong ties with Cormyr. Myth Drannor has also resurrected the ancient compact with the Dalelands. The elven realm is a force to be reckoned with once more. </specific>

Waters from various seas spill down from the heights, forming rapids and sparkling falls that tumble into the darkness below. Suspended in the air are curious motes, clumps of earth and stone that are crawling with strange creatures, wormed with tunnels, and laden with relics from the not-so-distant past. The East Rift is a wondrous place, with cunningly crafted switchback stairs, twisting pathways, and trained griffon steeds that all serve to connect the tiny communities that cling to the wounded stone. </specific>

    <specific name="Short Description"> Huddled on the eastern shelf of the yawning Underchasm, East Rift is a living symbol of gold dwarf ingenuity and stubbornness, having survived when the surface collapsed into the bowels of the Underdark. Protected by enormous towers connected by a high curtain wall, the gold dwarves are ready to defend themselves against the drow or any other horror that rises from the depths. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Durpar consists of the city of Vaelan, the town of Assur, and a handful of scattered keeps. Although largely forgotten by the rest of Faerûn, the region survives under the rulership of the Datharathi chaka, despite the threat of the surrounding Beastlands. Goblins of the Iron Eye tribe patrol the streets of Vaelan, and whispers speak of bribes paid to the shadowy Beast Lords, so some people might say that Durpar has already become a monster-ruled land. </specific>

    <specific name="Short Description"> The kingdom of Durpar lies south of the Raurin Desert, in the southeastern corner of Faerûn. Long thought destroyed by residents of the rest of the continent, this coastal kingdom is beset by the menacing monsters of the Beastlands. The remnants of Durpar's once-wealthy chakas (merchant houses) survive through trade with Estagund and High Imaskar, while the ruling Datharathi chaka experiments with magic crystal inlays. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Westgate is among the freest and the most disreputable locations in Faerûn, a place where coin can purchase anything. However, other areas have seen change in the past few decades. With the receding of the Sea of Fallen Stars, Ilipur and Pros have withered away into ghost towns.
	Nathlekh, Proskur, and Teziir, meanwhile, have seen a boom in trade. These cities have undergone transformations, emerging as law-bound centers of fair trade and honest dealings. Cormyr annexed Proskur in 1405 DR and later adopted Teziir as a protectorate. On the other hand, Nathlan (and its capital, Nathlekh) has emerged as a strong, independent country—the Eastern nation of the West, as some people say. </specific>

The Dragon Coast summons adventure to it as few other places in Faerûn do.
