Unseelie creatures are secretive and cling to the shadows whenever possible. Because of their reluctance to risk exposure, communicating with them can be difficult. You receive the gift of a secret language, making it easier to exchange missives with your patron.

The Thri-kreen language, unique to the mantis folk, includes rasps, buzzes, and clicks that members of other races find difficult to duplicate. Most thri-kreen in the Tyr Region do not read or write; the Chachik script is an art preserved only in the thri-kreen homelands in the far west.

  <RulesElement name="The language of the mind" type="Language" internal-id="ID_FMP_LANGUAGE_45" source="Psionic Power" revision-date="9/21/2010 3:01:31 PM">

Some psions believe that there exists a language of the mindâ€”an array of thoughts, visualizations, and sensations that are common to all thinking creatures across the cosmos. Those who study it believe that this universal mental language is the foundation on which all forms of telepathy are built.
	Optional Rule: With the Dungeon Master's permission, psionic characters can learn this language, which does not exist in spoken form, but only as a script. Players cannot choose the language of the mind as one of their characters' starting languages; leaning it requires the Linguist feat or the proper background. Only psionic characters and creatures who have innate telepathy can learn to read and write this language, since part of its meaning is conveyed directly into the observer's mind. It can be translated with magic (such as the Comprehend Languages ritual), but is otherwise a form of communication that only telepathic creatures can share.

The gods have their own language, Supernal, which they share with their angelic servants. When a god or angel speaks Supernal, listeners who don't speak Supernal understand the words as if the speaker used their own languages. The gods and angels can choose to disguise their speech, but in general Supernal is a universal language.
