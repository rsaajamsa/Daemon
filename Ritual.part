When you perform the ritual, you describe the desired construction in great detail. The hands start working as soon as they appear, assembling the structure from available material. They will quarry stone and cut it to shape, fell trees and saw them into lumber, gather reeds for thatch, and so on, but their range is limited to only a mile or so; they can't erect a stone cathedral in a sandy desert. They can also repair a ruined structure or use the material of a ruined structure to build something new. The hands cannot make attacks or deal damage, and they are impervious to damage.
  You can use this ritual to build a stronghold whose constructed space does not exceed 300 squares. That space can be divided and arranged any way you please but must be contiguous.
  With the DM's permission, you can use this ritual for other construction purposes such as building a bridge, carving stairs up the side of a mountain, and similar tasks.

This ritual aligns someone already invested with divine power with the deity or faith for which the ritual was created. It could be a deity that a person strayed from and wishes to return to, or it might be a different faith altogether. It cannot be performed by the character who is being reordained, but that character can assist. In most cases, the candidate for reordination is expected to complete a quest to prove his or her commitment to the new faith before the ritual is used.
    Upon completion of the ritual, its subject becomes associated with the appropriate deity, allowing him or her to select feats, powers, or any other class options requiring that tie. That person's previous association is dissolved, along with access to any related feats, powers, or other class options.
    If the ritual's subject is converting to a new deity, a single channel divinity feat associated with his or her former deity can be immediately exchanged for an appropriate one. For example, if a character previously worshiped Avandra and had the Avandra's Rescue feat, the character immediately loses the ability to use that feat but can automatically replace it with Raven Queen's Blessing, if the Raven Queen is the character's new patron deity.
    In addition, once the ritual is complete, the reordained character becomes vaguely aware of the existence and number of any agents (for example, angels, avengers, or other clerics) who have been charged with destroying him or her for crimes of heresy or apostasy. This awareness sharpens when such beings come within 1 mile of the character, but it does not identify or locate them. The awareness lasts for 7 days.

    <specific name="Type"> Ritual </specific>
You lure a spirit into an effigy of your construction, creating a scarecrow that guards a permanent designated area of 12 squares by 12 squares against trespassers. The scarecrow also grants its creator brief visions through its eyes until the scarecrow is destroyed or until its creator dismisses it. This protected area surrounds the scarecrow's mount and is established as the scarecrow's "haunting grounds."
	Before you cast this ritual, you gather the specific components for the type of scarecrow you wish to create and place them upon a scarecrow mount. This mount can be a high pole or stake, a tree, a fencepost, a wooden frame, or a similar structure from which the scarecrow can survey the area it guards. This mount is the scarecrow's permanent post. It can leave its mount at will and it can patrol its haunting grounds, but it cannot willingly venture beyond them unless a combat encounter causes it to cross the perimeter (but see below). At the end of such an encounter, the scarecrow returns to its haunting grounds.
	If the scarecrow's creator commands it beyond its haunting grounds, moves its mount, or releases it from service, the scarecrow gains its freedom and is no longer bound to its mount or its haunting grounds. It has complete free will and can do as it wishes. Some creators never bind their scarecrows to haunting grounds. Instead, they offer their free-willed creations friendship and the choice to ally with their creators as companion characters. Free-willed scarecrows created by good creatures often choose to serve their creators this way.
	To complete the Create Scarecrow ritual, make a DC 25 Arcana check.
	Success: You successfully create the scarecrow of your choice of the ritual caster's level or lower. Demon  scarecrows can be created with this ritual only after completing a successful performance of the summon demon ritual.
	Failure: No spirit is compelled to inhabit the effigy. Instead, minor spirit vestiges settle on the materials, allowing you to create 6 scarecrow shamblers to patrol the same haunting grounds.
	No matter how many creatures assist in the ritual, the creature that makes the Arcana check is considered the scarecrow's creator.
	A scarecrow created with this ritual gains the following encounter power.

Triggered Actions
Master's Sight * Encounter
Trigger: The scarecrow hits an enemy with a melee attack.
Effect (Free Action): The scarecrow's creator can see through the scarecrow's eyes until the start of the scarecrow's next turn.&lt;/table&gt;

The potent gas interferes with the thought processes of a creature so it acts in an inappropriate fashion. For intelligent creatures, this means laughter. When you cool the gas, it becomes liquid so you can transfer it into a glass bead for easy delivery.

When you master this ritual, you choose a single type of aberrant creature, such as chaos beast or mind flayer. This choice remains fixed throughout your adventuring career. If you are able to create ritual scrolls, any scrolls you create also reflect this choice. This ritual can only be mastered once.
	For the ritual's duration, you are able to determine the presence or absence of creatures of the chosen type within 10 miles, but with no specific direction or distance information. If there are any within range, you can connect to the mind of a random creature of that type and try to gain information from it. The strain of making this connection (and of concealing it from the aberrant creature) causes you to lose one healing surge.
	Your Dungeoneering check result determines how many questions you can try to find the answers to. Once you have asked all the questions allowed by the ritual, the ritual ends.
	Your questions can be as specific or as general as you wish, but the answers you receive back are cryptic and rarely longer than a phrase, a short sentence, or a single image. In particular, aberrant creatures often have different conceptions of time, so questions regarding future events or plans are more likely to result in answers that are incomprehensible. The answers are also limited to what the individual creature knows, and its information could be incorrect if it has been misled by others.

&lt;table&gt;Dungeoneering Check Result	Number of Questions
9 or lower	One
10-19	Two
20-29	Three
30-39	Four
40 or higher	Five&lt;/table&gt;

If a particular creature does not know the information you seek, you can try to find another individual who does know it. If there is another such creature, you lose an additional healing surge, and you may re-ask any questions you wish answers for.
	Members of the Morphic Web can master and perform this ritual even if they cannot normally master rituals. They also do not lose a healing surge when making the first connection to an aberrant creature.

You ward an area up to 10 squares by 10 squares, and designate a spoken password that allows a creature to enter the warded area without triggering an alarm. This alarm can send a mental signal to you or make an audible ringing sound.
	If a Tiny or larger creature enters the warded area without speaking the password, the alarm you set triggers, and the ritual is discharged. However, an insubstantial creature or any creature that succeeds on a Stealth check (DC 10 + your Arcana check modifier) does not trigger the alarm.
	The result of triggering the alarm depends on the type of alarm. When an audible alarm triggers, all creatures in the warded area that are capable of hearing can hear the ringing. If they are sleeping, the noise awakens them. When a mental alarm triggers, a mental ping alerts you of the intrusion and awakens you from sleep. In either case, the alarm informs you where the warded area was breached.
	Focus: While holding a tiny bell (5 gp), you use a fine silver wire (5 gp) to scribe runes on the warded area's perimeter.

You inscribe a glyph that works as a dangerous trap (see Glyph of Warding trap) on a flat surface such as a wall, chest lid, table, or door. As you create the trap, you set the glyph's damage type, trigger, password and/or exceptions. The trigger you set must require the trap's target to enter the glyph's square, pass within range of the glyph's attack, or open or handle a warded object without speaking the password or meeting an exception. Acceptable exceptions include creature origin, creature type, physical characteristics, and named individuals. The glyph becomes nearly invisible once it is completed. If the trap is triggered or disabled, the ritual is discharged.

You lay an illusion over an area of natural terrain, no more than 20 squares by 20 squares in size, to make it look, sound, and smell as if it were a different type of natural terrain. Artificial structures, equipment, and creatures cannot be changed. A meadow might look like a hill, a pond could look like a meadow, and so on; but a road or a tower in the area remains the same.
	A creature can discern the illusion if it succeeds on an Arcana check or a Perception check (DC 10 + your Arcana check modifier). This check is a minor action if the creature has not interacted with the illusion, but can be made as a free action the first time the creature interacts with the illusion. If you conceal an area of hindering terrain, a creature is still entitled to a saving throw if forced into that terrain.

You can ask one question regarding a particular action, framing the question so that the answer tells you whether the chosen action will benefit or harm you or an ally. This ritual can see only about half an hour into the future, and it deals only with the immediate effects of taking a specific action. The ritual cannot deduce long-term consequences or predict the outcome of long-term actions.
	Once you ask the question, the DM secretly rolls an Arcana check or Religion check (whichever provides the higher modifier) for you against a moderate DC. Your allies cannot aid you in making this check. If you try again to predict the outcome of the same action, the ritual supplies the same check result. 
	Successful Check: The DM tells you that the intended action should bring one of these results.
	Weal—a good result, such as when the reward outweighs the risk.
	Woe—a bad result, such as when the risk outweighs the reward.
	Weal and Woe—both good and bad, such as when the reward is equal to the risk.
	Nothing—neither a good nor a bad result.
	Failed Check: As per “nothing” above. You can't tell if this “nothing” is due to a successful check or a failed check.

	A scrying sensor appears as a shimmer in the air. Creatures can spot the sensor by succeeding on a Perception check (DC 10 + your level).
	Some warding rituals can block scrying sensors. If the location is so warded, or the location is otherwise unviable as a scrying target, then you learn this fact as soon as you start the ritual. You can then stop the ritual before you expend any components.

The summoned gargoyle understands anything you command, but it cannot speak any new languages.

Once summoned, the gargoyle guards one object or an area until it is killed. The gargoyle attacks any creature that appeoaches the object or enters the area, though it allows for any exceptions you make. Runic gargoyles protect you, rather than an object or a location.

	You create a doorway to another time, linking the present with the past or the future. By stepping through the portal, you move to another point on the time line.
	The ritual works only if you perform it within a permanent teleportation circle. The portal opens within the circle.
	During the ritual's performance, make a History check. The result determines how far into the past or future you can travel.
	
&lt;table&gt;History Check Result	Distance in Time

	When you finish performing the ritual, the spirit of yourself from an earlier time you choose appears before you. It is the person you were at that time, and it approaches you with that perspective. You can converse with the spirit for the duration of the ritual. If you remember the right time in your own past to call on the spirit, you can question yourself when important knowledge is still fresh in your mind.
	
	The Speak to the Youth Within ritual seemingly died with Omarosa, since she kept it a closely guarded secret. Possessing the torc of the younger self does not impart knowledge of the ritual. Each time a character uses the torc's utility power, he or she should attempt a DC 34 Arcana check. If successful, the character realizes that the torc has another function but receives no indication of what that function is.
	A character can uncover the lost ritual through research into the torc's history. Hired sages can perform the research, or characters can tackle it themselves. Rituals such as Consult Mystic Sages, Consult Oracle, and Loremaster's Bargain are another option. Any route can culminate in a quest to locate Omarosa's tomb and question her using the Speak with Dead ritual.

All agree that fire was the first element to be distilled into a pure essence whose destructive energy could be safely contained.  Some say Vol Tomo created alchemist's fire to give common people a weapon against the young empire of Bael Turath, and that the tieflings' rise to imperial power was hastened because only they could survive when peasants threw a flask of the fiery stuff through a noble's carriage window.  The variant essences that were later developed are often called alchemist's frost, alchemist's acid, alchemist's spark, and alchemist's venom.

The problem they encountered was that as the amount of each reagent is increased, the length of time the plaster stays wet decreases.

You call on a specific demon, pulling its awareness across planar boundaries to where you wait. You must name a specific demon when you perform this ritual, then make an Arcana or Religion check with a -10 penalty. The check result is the maximum level of the demon whose attention you can attract. If the demon you named in performing the ritual is at this level or lower, a fragment of its will manifests before you. If the demon you named is higher than the maximum level you can summon, it is aware of your summons but can choose to send an underling to answer the call instead.
	Once a demon has manifested, you can interact with it verbally or by telepathy as if it were present. The manifestation has no physical presence, and it cannot attack or be attacked. Demons possess esoteric knowledge and the ability to empower mortals in numerous ways, but the advice or power of a demon is never given freely. Some demons accept trade of magic items or secrets, while others demand favors or promises for their aid and information. Some demons offer service in exchange for being told what unpleasant ends the boon is to be used for.
	The ritual facilitates the bargain between you and the summoned demon, imbuing you with a small amount of abyssal power or knowledge. The terms of the bargain are up to you, but the DM determines the scope of power and knowledge that a demon can impart.
	In addition, convincing a demon to provide what you need typically requires a skill challenge. The details of this challenge are left up to the DM, but can include such elements as bargaining with Diplomacy, threatening with Intimidate, or coercing with knowledge gleaned by Arcana or Religion. Failure ends the ritual and might bring the summoned demon to your location in physical form.
	Special: If you use a demon's truename in the ritual in place of its name, you take no penalty to the Arcana or Religion check made for the ritual. In addition, you do not need to undertake a skill challenge to bargain with the summoned demon (at the DM's discretion).
	Few demons except demon lords have truenames, and demon lords guard their truenames at any cost. If you summon a demon lord by the use of its truename, the bargain you strike should also involve ensuring that you are not destroyed once the pact is completed.
	Focus: A circle of summoning runes. These are traditionally forged of silver and inlaid on the ground, but the runes can also be inscribed within a gemstone or crafted of gold and worn as jewelry. This focus must be crafted by the caster.

The component cost is equal to the price of the magic armor you create.

&lt;table&gt;Armor Created	Minimum Level	Component Cost
+1 magic armor	4th	360 gp
+2 magic armor	6th	1,800 gp

When complete, this ritual calls forth a spiritual presence, or “fetch,” of a shape you define. Typically, these fetches are small, indistinct, and shaped like a small animal or person. You can send this spirit to a creature (or creatures) whose specific appearance you can visualize or whose name you can provide, or to whom you have a material connection such as a vial of blood. You whisper a simple command of 10 words of less, such as “Come to me,” “Bring me the ritual components,” or “Burn down the fortress wall.”
The fetch then goes to find the creature you designated at a rapid pace (speed 15) and seeks out the creature you specify. It cannot communicate, but the recipient senses its presence and receives your command. Unless the recipient does as you wish, the fetch remains at the target's side as a constant reminder. The fetch cannot be harmed, but dispel magic used successfully can drive it away for a day.
Your skill check result determines how long the fetch exists.

False Aura makes a nonmagical item seem to be a magic item, making it appear magical to an Arcana check to detect magic. Your Arcana check result determines the DC for someone else's Arcana check to detect magic to see through your deception. If the detect magic check fails, the inspecting character believes the item to be magical. You choose the fake power source of the item when performing the ritual. However, anyone attempting to use the item immediately recognizes its magic as fake.
The ritual's effects last for 24 hours.
Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by leaving the item near a small, jeweled eye of gold and ruby wrapped in a silken blindfold. The blindfolded eye is a focus worth 100 gp. As long as the item remains within 20 squares of the focus, the False Aura remains in effect. You can hide or protect the ritual's focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within range. A single focus can maintain up to five Aura Masks (see Aura Mask ritual) or False Auras on five separate items, as long as they are all close enough to the focus.

A primal grove is a haven that is magically hidden by primal spirits. You use this ritual either to create a grove and an entrance to it or to create an entrance to a grove that you or someone else created.

Creating a Grove: When you create a grove, it appears in a hidden location in the world or the Feywild, and you determine its password. You also create an entrance to it (see “Creating an Entrance” below).

A grove generates enough food and drink to sustain its occupants and has a moderate, unchanging climate. If you move objects into a grove, they remain there when you leave, but food and other resources created by the grove disappear when removed.

Your Nature check determines the grove's size in squares and how many creatures it can accommodate.

Creating an Entrance: A primal grove is inaccessible, except to those who know its password and pass through an entrance to it. You use this ritual to create an entrance to a primal grove, the password of which you must know.

When you create an entrance to a grove, the entrance appears in a square adjacent to you. If a creature that knows the grove's password enters that square, the creature can teleport to a square in the grove. Anyone inside the grove can exit it as part of a move action, teleporting either to an active entrance or to the most recent entrance if none are active.

Your Nature check determines the duration of the entrance. When you create a grove, you use a single check to create both the grove and an entrance to it. As a minor action, you can close an entrance you created.

&lt;table&gt;Nature Check Result	Entrance Duration
24 or lower	1 hour
25–34	24 hours
35–44	1 month
45 or higher	1 year&lt;/table&gt;

Extraordinary magic might allow someone to enter a grove against the creator's will.

Succor attunes the ritual's focus to the site, linking the two until the ritual is discharged. After the time required to perform the ritual, the creature holding the focus can spend a standard action to activate the ritual's effect: At the end of the creature's next turn, the creature and up to eight willing creatures within its line of sight teleport to the holy site to which the focus was attuned, and the ritual is discharged. Succor crosses any distance and planar boundaries.

Any effect or condition that prevents teleportation also prevents this ritual from functioning (but does not discharge it).

At the ritual's completion, designate an action or a kind of behavior that the mark forbids, and select one of the following penalties or another worked out by you and your DM. When the subject performs the forbidden action or displays the forbidden behavior, the subject is affected by the penalty for the next 24 hours. Example penalties include the following:

Ineptness: When the subject makes a successful d20 roll, it must roll again and use the second result.
Weakness of Flesh: The subject gains vulnerable 10 to all damage.
Curse of Solitude: The subject is blinded and deafened.

The Hallowed Temple ritual creates a shimmering temple associated with your deity. The temple occupies a close burst 7 as it materializes around you. The structure incorporates as many appropriate artistic elements as you like: the exterior features iconography, stained-glass windows, and other decorative features, and the interior contains an altar, statues, or other appropriate items related to your faith.

The temple is comfortable, and creatures inside it feel close to your god. It is immune to damage. Access to the interior is through the temple's front (and only) door. The walls of the temple, including the door, are solid obstacles.  The temple and all its contents (even items removed from the temple) vanish at the end of the ritual's duration.

Demons and undead cannot cross the temple's threshold.  Any creatures within the burst (except for you) when the temple materializes are displaced to a space outside the temple as close to their former location as possible.  If insufficient space exists either for the temple itself or for the displacement of creatures, the ritual cannot be performed.

You command an immortal creature whose level does not exceed yours. The subject of this ritual must be able to see and hear you and must remain within 5 squares of you for the entire time necessary to perform the ritual.  Because most creatures do not willingly submit to this ritual, you must usually make the creature helpless or restrain the creature by means of a Magic Circle ritual.  Unless it is prevented from doing so, the creature can leave at any time. Finally, you must be able to communicate with the creature, or the ritual automatically fails.

To determine the extent of your authority over the subject, you engage in a special skill challenge during the time it takes to perform the ritual. The DCs for the checks in this challenge are equal to the subject's level + 10. Religion is the primary skill; each time you or an ally succeeds on a Religion check in the challenge, you or an ally can use Diplomacy, History, Arcana, or Intimidate for one subsequent check. Once you have amassed 3 failures or achieved 10 successes, the skill challenge ends. Consult the following table and apply the effect associated with the number of successes you achieved.

&lt;table&gt;Number of Successes	Effect
0 or 1	The creature has authority over you and can issue one command that you must obey, a task that requires up to a day of effort.
2 or 3	You have immediate authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform one task that takes no more than 5 minutes.
4 or 5	You have moderate authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a day of effort.
6 or 7	You have significant authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a week of effort.
8 or 9	You have great authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a month of effort. 
10	You have ultimate authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a year and a day of effort.&lt;/table&gt;

When the specified task is completed, the ritual is discharged, and the creature (or you) is released from service. You can request any kind of service that does not compel the subject to obey multiple commands, force the subject to engage in combat, or ensure the subject's death. (The subject can engage in combat to achieve a task if it wishes, but combat cannot be required.) If the task is impossible, such as commanding a creature that cannot fly to soar into the sky, the creature can ignore the command.

To perform this ritual, you require a single warwing drake bound inside a magic circle drawn to bind a natural creature. When you successfully perform this ritual, the warwing drake is tamed as determined by your Arcana or Nature check result.
&lt;table&gt;Check Result	Effect on Warwing Drake

A tame and trained warwing drake is ready to accept a rider and riding gear, and it understands commands. It is loyal to the ritual caster or someone the ritual caster designates. Such a drake can be trained to accept other potential riders and masters. If the ritual grants the drake the ability to speak, the drake speaks in a broken form of a language the ritual caster selects. If use of this ritual reduces a warwing drake to 0 Intelligence, the drake dies.

You target a dazed, stunned, or helpless Large or smaller anaxim whose level is less than your own. The anaxim must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, the anaxim follows you, avoiding direct danger and refusing to follow instructions other than the one: attack a group of foes.

Upon receiving this verbal instruction, combat begins. The anaxim fights until the foes you indicate are destroyed or until it is destroyed. The anaxim uses basic attacks each round except on rounds when you expend a minor action to urge it to use one of its other attacks.

When the combat ends or the ritual's duration ends, your influence ends and the anaxim reverts to its natural behavior; it simply leaves unless you attack it.

This ritual is performed on an adjacent corpse. It binds the soul to the focus, preventing its passage to Dolurrh. The target must be willing to allow the ritual to take effect, otherwise the ritual fails. Once so bound, the soul rests in state of torpor.
At any time thereafter, once per day, you can ask a single question of the corpse as if you had performed the Speak with Dead ritual, and, as with the ritual, the corpse knows only the information it knew in life.
You can perform the Raise Dead ritual on a corpse preserved by this ritual regardless of how long it stays in stasis. You cannot restore life to a creature that died from old age.
If the focus or corpse is destroyed before the target is restored to life, the soul is released and the ritual ends.

Upon completing the ritual, you and up to eight allies assume the appearance of any Medium humanoid creatures.

The ritual's effect is centered on you; if any ally moves more than 5 squares away from you, the ritual's effect ends for that ally.
Creatures viewing or interacting with you or your allies can make an Insight check to detect the deception. The check's DC equals your Arcana check result. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees you and each time it interacts with you or one of your allies. If the creature touches you or an ally, it automatically realizes the deception.

The shelter is not heated or cooled, but it is immune to fire and impervious to all damage. Access to its interior is by two shuttered windows, a single door, and a chimney. Furniture can be removed from the shelter, but it vanishes along with the lodge when the ritual's duration expires.

The hollow has a glowing light you can control and is filled with sweet air. You can remain within the bole for up to 12 hours. Thereafter, or when you will it to be so, you and all the creatures the ritual took to the hollow return to the exact place they left. Only 1 hour of time has passed in the world. If you took an extended rest within the bole, you must wait 12 hours after your return to the world to take another one.
If you have assistance when performing this ritual, divide the casting time by the number of participants. The assistants all chant in a fey harmony while you perform the ritual. Anyone you want to assist you in this way can learn the proper harmony during an extended rest.

You cause a body of water to reduce in depth. Your Nature check determines how many squares the water lowers. The space of water you can affect has sides equal to your level in squares. For example, if you are level 12, you affect a space that is 12 squares on a side. If you lower the water to ground level or lower, the affected area becomes dry.

You imprison a creature within a demiplane created by this ritual. The creature to be imprisoned must be either helpless or willing, and it must be present for the entire performance of the ritual. When the ritual is complete, an invisible magical field envelops the creature, putting it into suspended animation, and the creature falls into a space beyond the normal bounds of the cosmos. Only divination rituals performed by creatures of your level or higher can determine the location of the imprisoned creature.
You must set one or more possible conditions that release the creature, should they come to pass. You can set an imprisoned creature free by performing a ritual of release that has no component cost and takes 1 hour. A freed creature has no memory of the events that occurred during its imprisonment, and it appears in the world on the ground closest to where it was imprisoned.

When you complete the ritual, you touch a willing or helpless creature and see the most defining moments of the creature's life. The images appear in order from the most important to the least. Your Arcana check determines the number of past scenes you see. The scenes you view are those most pivotal to the creature's history and are not chosen by any agency. Performing this ritual more than once on the same creature invariably displays the same scenes unless the creature has experienced defining moments since the last time you performed the ritual.

You layer enchanted defenses over an area you own or inhabit no larger than 30 squares by 30 squares and 100 feet (20 squares) in height.
The area fills with dense fog that makes the area heavily obscured. You and any creature you invite into the area can see through the fog as if the fog was not there. You can grant a creature a temporary invitation of any set length or revoke an invitation if you are in the presence of the invited creature or in the area of the ritual's effect.
All doors, windows, and other sealable nonmagical portals are locked using Arcane Lock. You create a number of hallucinatory items as per the ritual of the same name equal to one-fifth of your Arcana check result. The hallucinatory items created most often are false doors and false walls. Consult the Arcane Lock and Hallucinatory Item rituals for their effects, and use your Arcana check result to determine their properties.
The warding effect lasts for 24 hours, but you can extend this duration by spending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. You do not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.

When you perform the Anthem of Unity for a crowd of  ordinary people—peasants, commoners, artisans, and the like—you unite them behind a single cause. Only creatures whose level is at least 2 lower than yours are affected by this ritual.
The crowd must not be hostile to you and must be able to see and hear you for the entire performance. At the end of the ritual, you can request a single service from the crowd, to which the members of the audience respond as if you were a trusted friend. You can request anything that doesn't involve violence, put the listeners at inordinate risk or imperil their friends or family, or place them in financial ruin. For example, you might ask the listeners to help put out a fire raging in the city, hide you and your allies from searching guards, or provide you with shelter or food. A Diplomacy check made at the end of this ritual determines what sort of help you can request.

You transfer the magical qualities (properties, powers, and enhancement bonus) of an enchanted item into another object. You must maintain physical contact with both items for the duration of the ritual. The receiving item must occupy the same magic item slot (head, waist, armor, and so on) and be the same type (wand, rod, weapon, and so on) as the original item. The enchantment to be moved must be valid for the receiving item, so that you cannot transfer ranged weapon properties to melee weapons, cloth-only armor properties to chainmail, and so on.
  You can transfer an enchantment to an item that already contains a lower-level enchantment, but the receiving item's previous magic is lost. For example, the enhancement bonus and power of a suit of +1 barkskin hide (5th level) could be placed into a suit of +1 curseforged scale (3rd level), but the scale armor's existing power is lost in doing so.

You create a shortcut across the fabric of the world, linking your location with a permanent teleportation circle elsewhere on the same plane (see the Linked Portal ritual, Player's Handbook, page 307). As part of performing this ritual, you sketch out a 10-foot-diameter circle in rare chalks and inks. Alternatively, you can use a permanent teleportation circle, which reduces the component cost to 150 gp and grants you a +5 bonus to your Arcana check.
At the ritual's completion, make an Arcana check. The result determines the duration that the portal remains open.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Portal Duration
19 or lower	1 round
20–39	3 rounds
40 or higher	5 rounds&lt;/table&gt;

The portal displays views of the other location in the same way as that created by the Linked Portal ritual, but creatures cannot enter the origin point and appear at the other location. Instead, creatures can only step into the distant end of the portal to appear at the origin point with you.

You call a nature spirit into your service to act as a guide. The guide takes the form of a Medium or smaller natural beast, with defenses equal to yours at the time you perform the ritual. The guide has 1 hit point, and a missed attack never damages it. It has a speed of 8, but it measures its pace so that you and your party can keep up with it.
The guide leads you to a location you name as you perform the ritual. The destination must be a specific place, such as Shathrax's Lair or the Tower of Kettenor. The guide cannot lead you to a general location, such as “a cave full of treasure,” or to an unknown place, such as “the secret lair of the dragon Arrythis.” For the ritual's duration, the guide leads you to the destination by the shortest (although not necessarily the safest) route.

You enchant a skull to watch over an area and alert you when something intrudes. The skull uses your Perception modifier with a +5 bonus. It cannot hear or smell, and it never considers you an intruder. In addition, you can designate any number of other individuals as nonintruders. When you perform the ritual, you can also designate one or more categories of creatures that the skull will ignore. You can define these categories by obvious physical characteristics (such as height, weight, or body shape), creature type (such as humanoid), creature race (such as hill giant), or obvious equipment (such as a creature carrying a shield with a flame emblazoned upon it).
	When the skull detects an intrusion, it mentally alerts you if you are within 1 mile. At any time during the ritual's duration, you can choose to look through the skull's eyes as a standard action. While you look through the skull's eyes, you cannot see through your own and are considered blind. You can end this effect as a free action.

You create a portal similar to that produced by Linked Portal, but connecting your present location to that of a corpse. You must have a piece of the corpse—at least as much as the tip of a finger—in your possession to begin the ritual. This piece is consumed at the ritual's completion.
	If the target corpse is alive, animate, undead, or otherwise more than a simple corpse, or if the corpse is on another plane, the ritual fails and no components (including the bit of the corpse) are expended.

You sever the magical connections that bind one place to another by way of a portal. The completion of this ritual successfully shuts a currently active portal and seals it. No creature, object, or energy can pass through a sealed portal. The portal is not destroyed, though it becomes both invisible and intangible, meaning that it cannot be perceived or interacted with while sealed. If the portal would normally disappear after a certain amount of time, it does so.
	At the completion of this ritual, make an Arcana check. A sealed portal can be reopened with the linked portal, planar portal, or true portal rituals, but the creature performing the ritual to reopen the portal must make an Arcana check that equals or exceeds the results of the Arcana check you made when performing this ritual. You can remove the seal on a portal you have sealed by performing this ritual on it again.
	The magic of a sealed portal can be detected with the Arcana skill. The level of the magical phenomenon (the seal, not the portal itself) is equal to your level at the time you performed this ritual.

When you perform Rope Trick, the ritual's focus passes through a portal and into a temporary demiplane. The portal entrance occupies 1 square. A creature can climb down the rope into a demiplane that is 2 squares high, 8 squares long, and 8 squares wide.
	The entrance to the demiplane appears as a subtle shimmer and has solid transparency. A successful Perception check (DC 15 + half your level) allows a creature outside the portal to detect the entrance. The portal can be locked with the Arcane Lock ritual, and unless you choose to lock the portal, the demiplane remains accessible from the outside.
	Once the ritual ends, the demiplane disappears, and any creatures or objects in the demiplane appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the demiplane's former entrance. The ritual's focus appears where the demiplane's entrance was. The ritual caster can choose to end the ritual at any time.

You create a teleportation circle with a unique sequence of magic sigils, which you and other ritual casters can useas a location marker for rituals such as Linked Portal and Planar Portal. The teleportation circle does not transport creatures anywhere on its own—it merely enables other travel rituals. The ritual caster chooses the size of the teleportation circle, which in turn affects the ritual's component cost: 1 square, 4 squares (a 2-square-by-2-square area), 9 squares (a 3-square-by-3-square area), or 16 squares (a 4-square-by-4-square area).
	The teleportation circle lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster can extend the duration by spending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to see or even be on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the teleportation circle becomes permanent.

The guide cannot lead you to a general location, such as “a room with astral diamonds” or to an unknown place, like “the death knight Malachi's hiding place.” If the named location does exist within the Astral Sea, the guide leads you there by the shortest (though not always the safest) route.

This ritual creates watchful eyes that you place in any square within 10 squares of where you perform the ritual.Your Arcana check result determines how many eyes you can place and what type of vision or sensory ability they possess.
	The watchful eyes function like those of the Eye of Alarm ritual, except as follows. When the eyes detect an intruder, they sound no audible alarm, but instead alert you through a telepathic link. This link functions regardless of distance, though you must remain on the same plane.
	The watchful eye also creates a mild connection between you and the creature that triggered it. “The creature that triggered the Sentinel Eye ritual's watchful eye” is sufficient identification for the Observe Creature ritual, if you wish to spy on it at a later date using that ritual. You can use the View Location ritual to spy on the location where a triggered creature was when the eye was triggered, if you have that ritual, since you obviously know the area in which you performed Sentinel Eye. (However, that use has limited utility given the 1 hour performance time of View Location.)
	The ritual's effects last for 24 hours.
	Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by keeping a focus in the vicinity. This ritual focus is a small, jeweled eye made of gold and ruby, worth 2,000 gp. The Sentinel Eye lasts as long as the focus remains within 20 squares of any of the watchful eyes.

You create a slight dimensional warp along the length of a corridor, allowing it to hold larger creatures or objects than it otherwise could. A creature of a size that would normally have to squeeze through the area can instead move and act freely. A creature one size category too large to enter the space at all can instead do so by squeezing.
	Your Arcana or Nature check result determines the maximum dimensions of the area affected.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana or Nature Check Result		Area Affected
9 or lower	Up to 1 square wide and 2 squares long
10–19	Up to 1 square wide and 4 squares long
20–29	Up to 2 squares wide and 4 squares long
30–39	Up to 2 squares wide and 8 squares long
40 or higher	Up to 3 squares wide and 12 squares long&lt;/table&gt;

	For example, a Huge creature with a space of 3 (9 squares) could freely move through an area 2 squares wide and could squeeze into an area 1 square wide. A Gargantuan creature with a space of 4 (16 squares) could freely move through an area 3 squares wide, and could squeeze into an area 2 squares wide, but would still be unable to enter an area 1 square wide. The ritual's effects last for 24 hours.
	Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely keeping a focus in the vicinity. This ritual focus is a small hand, sculpted of platinum, worth 100 gp. The Easy Passage lasts as long as the focus remains within the affected area. You can hide or protect the ritual's focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within the area defined by your Arcana or Nature check result.

You create a shortcut across the world. Other than as described here, this ritual functions like Linked Portal. The teleportation circle must be inside a doorway or similar opening that connects to another doorway or opening within 50 squares (250 feet), which you designate when you perform the ritual. The doorways can each be up to 4 squares in width. As part of performing the ritual, you must adorn the door frame or perimeter of the portal with various sigils and runes.
	Your Arcana check determines how long the portal remains open and how well hidden it is (if you choose to make it secret).
	When performing the ritual, you can choose whether the portal is obvious or hidden. If obvious, anyone looking through the enchanted doorway can see a hazy image of the destination, as defined in Linked Portal.
	If you choose to hide it, however, casual examination shows only a mirror image of the room in which the doorway is set. The effect is that if the door is opened or the doorway is looked through, the area beyond the door looks like another room of the sort one is already in. Dragons and wizards use this technique to make travel through their lairs difficult for those who do not know to avoid the portals.
	A Perception check, with a DC equal to your Arcana check result when performing the ritual, is required to detect the deception. Success indicates that the observer sees a hazy image of the destination instead, as described in the Linked Portal ritual.
	If the real destination is an area of obvious danger—a gaping chasm, a room on fire, a pit of spikes—then the portal cannot be hidden. You could, however, hide a portal that leads to a room full of secret traps, or one in which a monster is lurking just out of sight.

Special: You must possess an innate breath weapon You cause creatures in a warded area to gain vulnerability to whatever damage type you deal with your breath weapon. (A red dragon, for instance, would bestow fire vulnerability with this ritual.) Any time an intruder takes damage of the appropriate type, it takes the extra damage.
	Your Arcana check determines the size of the area warded, as well as the extent of the vulnerability.
	You are automatically immune to your own Chamber of Vulnerability. In addition, you can designate any number of other ritual participants as being immune also. When you perform the ritual, you can also designate one or more categories of creatures that are immune to the ritual's effects. You can define these categories by obvious physical characteristics (such as height, weight, or body shape), creature type (such as dragon), creature race (such as blue dragon), or obvious equipment (such as a creature wearing a specific signet ring).
	The ritual's effects last for 24 hours.
	Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by keeping a focus in the vicinity. This ritual focus is a small fanged mouth carved of ivory and silver, worth 2,500 gp. The Chamber of Vulnerability lasts as long as the focus remains within the area of effect. You can hide or protect the ritual's focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within range.

When performed upon a magic item, Aura Mask makes it appear nonmagical when someone tries to use an Arcana check to detect magic. Your Arcana check result determines the DC for the Arcana check to see through your deception. The Arcana check DC to determine that an item is magical is the higher of the item's normal DC or the result of your Arcana check made as part of this ritual.
	The ritual's effects last for 24 hours.
	Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by leaving the item near a small, jeweled eye of gold and ruby wrapped in a silken blindfold. The blindfolded eye is a focus worth 100 gp. As long as the item remains within 20 squares of the focus, the Aura Mask remains in effect. You can hide or protect the ritual's focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within range. A single focus can maintain up to five Aura Masks or False Auras on five separate items, as long as they are all close enough to the focus.

No telepathy or other mental communication can cross the boundary of Voicecatcher Veil, unless the creature using it is either of a higher level than the ritual caster who performed the ritual, or that ritual caster permits it. When mental communication is attempted across the ward's boundary, the ritual caster is instantly aware of the attempt and the contents of the message. The caster can then choose to bar the message or let it pass, as long as the caster is capable of thought. (If the caster is incapable of thought or dead, the veil automatically bars all communication.) The ritual caster can pass this power and responsibility on to another creature in the presence of the veil by spending a healing surge; that individual can likewise pass it to another by the same means. Your Arcana check result determines the size of the warded area, which is a burst.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Warded Area
9 or lower	Burst 1

The warding effect lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster (not any assistants) can extend this duration by spending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.

Escape from these bonds is at a DC equal to the Arcana check result plus 5, and the ritual's magic prevents the target from teleporting unless the prisoner's level is higher than that of the ritual caster.

You enchant a stack of paper or a book to capture the words spoken around it, recording them as a faithful and infallible stenographer. There is no apparent writing implement, just a slight scratching sound as the words appear. The component costs include 5 gp for ink the ritual exhausts; a ritual caster who wishes the transcription to be of higher quality should replace this cost with that of higher-quality inks. The phantom scribe does its best to correctly record what is said in its hearing (its Perception bonus is equal to your Arcana bonus) and properly attribute each statement.
	It cannot attribute words from a creature it does not know. Depending on the caster's personality, a scribe might name unknown speakers colorfully, as the “Dark Stranger” or “Breathless Guest”; or simply, with labels such as “Unknown Speaker One.” If such a speaker is later identified, the scribe records that.

You ward an area against intrusion, setting an Eye of Alarm (Player's Handbook, page 304) anywhere within 20 squares of where you perform the ritual. If the eye detects an intruder, it psychically and silently alerts you no matter where you are, and you can teleport to the square the eye occupies as a standard action. Up to 8 willing allies within 10 squares of you can accompany you, appearing adjacent to you, or as near as possible at the end of the teleportation.
	The eye never considers you an intruder, you can designate any number of other ritual participants as nonintruders,
and you can designate additional categories of creatures that do not set off the alarm, as normal for the Eye of Alarm. Most who perform this ritual allow it to ignore small creatures and pests, since the eye does not describe what sets it off.
	The warding effect lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster (not any assistants) can extend this duration by spending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.
	Your Arcana check result determines how many eyes you can place and what type of vision or sensory ability they possess.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Eyes Created	Vision or Ability
19 or lower	One	Normal
20-39	Three	Darkvision

Farsight functions as the Wizard's Sight ritual, but you can place your scrying sensor in any square you can see, no matter how far. You can see and hear as if you were standing there, and you have darkvision through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor. You cannot place the scrying sensor in a location you can see only through a scrying sensor.
	Your Arcana check result determines how long the sensor lasts.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Duration
19 or lower	2 rounds
20–24	3 rounds
25–29	4 rounds
30–39	5 rounds
40 or higher	6 rounds&lt;/table&gt;

	The ritual creates a scrying sensor—a shimmer in the air—that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed at a  Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way.
	Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block Farsight. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components. 
	Focus: A mirror or a crystal ball worth at least 2,500 gp. The focus conveys what you see and hear.

You create a magical barrier that is up to 2 squares long and tall, and is typically large enough to block a doorway or the entrance of a hallway. The obstruction is invisible from more than 10 squares away but is readily apparent as a translucent, shimmering, paper-thin wall from closer than that.
	When creating the barrier, you also determine circumstances that open the barrier; this is the same as for Arcane Lock (Player's Handbook, page 301). Your Arcana check, with a +5 bonus, determines the DC for Knock or similar rituals to open it, and the DC to burst the barrier with a Strength check is 5 greater than that.
	If you spend 4 hours and four times the component costs to perform this ritual, the duration increases to permanent. A ritual caster who uses Knock or a similar ritual to open a permanent Arcane Barrier can choose to bring it down temporarily, in which case it seals again after 5 minutes, or to destroy the barrier.

Targets of the Waterborn ritual can explore the ocean's depths at length and with leisure. Up to eight creatures (including yourself if you choose) gain the ability to breathe underwater. In addition to this ability, targets can speak normally and gain a swim speed equal to their land speed. Subjects are unaffected by the cold and pressure of the deep ocean.
	This ritual does not negate the ability to breathe air or move on land. Equipment and possessions, such as books and scrolls, on a creature affected by the ritual remain undamaged by the water.

Speckled across Toril are countless portals called fey crossroads. Each such portal forms at a place where the barrier between the Feywild and the world is especially thin.
	This ritual allows you and your allies access to a fey crossroads of your choice, enabling you to use the Feywild as a conduit between two locations in the world. Completing the ritual conveys you and your allies a certain distance through the world. These crossroads are undependable means of travel, however, and walkers on these paths never end up exactly where they intend to go. You and your friends exit the crossroads a certain distance away from your intended destination, and the crossroads often deposit their travelers in precarious or interesting locations.
	Your Nature check result determines the greatest distance you can travel. You can always choose for your maximum travel to correspond to a lower check result if you desire, and by doing so you can reduce the distance to your intended destination. For example, if you want to travel only 10 miles but your check result is 40, you can apply the outcome for a check result of 21–30. As a result, you end up 1d4 miles away from your intended destination instead of 1d10 miles.

Time Ravager magically accelerates the effects of time on an object, causing it to weaken, decay, and crumble into dust. This ritual affects only nonmagical inanimate objects such as gear, armor, weapons, food, and corpses. A single performance destroys a 5-foot cube of materials of a type based on the Arcana check result.
	Unpreserved Organic Materials: This category includes any foodstuffs, liquids, uncured leather, plant materials, carcasses, and so on. A successful ritual results in transforming this substance into foul-smelling slime.

You create a source of dim light that allows you and those around you to see without your being seen because of your light source.
	The Dark Light ritual creates a ball of shadow that floats with you as you walk. It sheds dim light within 6 squares around it.
	In its light, you can see everything clearly. Only creatures within the light's radius can see the Dark Light ball or the dim light it creates. Vision within the Dark Light effect is in black-and-white, and color variations appear in shades of gray.

You target an area burst 3 within 10 squares. Debris, rubble, and other detritus flattens to the ground, shifts out of the way, or otherwise ceases to be an obstacle. This ritual does not affect solid earth or rock; thus, it can be used to clear the wreckage of a collapsed tunnel, but not to create such a passage where one did not already exist. Its most common use is to flatten or smooth a path so as to eliminate difficult terrain. It does not affect manufactured walls, floors, or ceilings, traps, or magical barriers.

When you perform this ritual, choose a specific active and permanent portal you can clearly see. Analyze Portal causes the portal to erupt with faint lights that flicker and spin, letting you learn a great deal about its destination and function. Its most basic effect is to reveal the portal's destination. Although a portal usually displays what its destination looks like, this ritual reveals the destination's name and its general location in the world or the plane on which it is located.
	When you learn the origin and type of the last creature to use the portal, you also learn any keywords associated with that creature.
	Analyze Portal can also reveal the identity of the creature that created the portal. If no creature created it, you learn of the event that created it.

You capture the writing from one source (a book, scroll, or tablet) and cause it to appear onto a special prepared paper, parchment, book, or some other similar item. This ritual copies up to 250 words of text, enough to fill one page with text. A copied illustration counts as a number of words proportional to the amount of the page the illustration requires.
	This ritual can be used to copy a ritual scroll, even if you have not mastered the ritual on the original scroll. Creating a ritual scroll in this manner takes twice as long as creating a ritual book but has the same cost (in addition to the component cost of this ritual).

This complicated and deeply evil ritual must be performed a total of nine times to subjugate the will of a creature held in Thakorsil's Seat. Each performance has the following requirements.
	It must be performed during a full moon within 20 feet of Thakorsil's Seat.
	It requires the sacrifice of a good-aligned creature of at least paragon tier. That creature dies at the last second
of the performance, when its body and spirit are utterly destroyed—hence “twin burnings.”
	If the performance is successful, it creates a triangular crystalline pane etched with a rune of chaos. The pane
appears near the Seat. Any damage destroys a pane, but only missing panes must be replaced in further performance.
	If an individual performance is interrupted, it fails. Panes already created remain, though, and the overarching
ritual can continue from that point.
	If nine performances are successfully completed, a nine-sided crystal pyramid encloses Thakorsil's Seat. The
occupant of the artifact can then physically leave the Seat but is permanently and totally enslaved to the one who
completed the ritual.

This brief ritual reinforces the bond between the Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Willing participants swear loyalty to one another or pledge to accomplish some task.
	During the ritual, you hold forth your iron ring for all to see and focus upon. Participants who swear the oath required by the pact are bound by their word. Not all participants in the ritual need swear the oath—it can bind some and not others. You can secretly exclude any participant, including yourself, even if he or she appears to swear the oath. However, even someone who is coerced or charmed into swearing the oath is still bound by it.
	Those who forge such a pact are bound for all time. Any who fail to uphold the bargain are cursed for the rest of their days, considered pactbroken by their peers. The Remove Affliction ritual ends the effects of the Pact of the Iron Ring, before or after a creature breaks the pact. A ritual caster gains a +2 bonus to Heal checks when lifting the curse from one who was magically compelled to swear the pact.

At the conclusion of this ritual, you die, transform into a lich, and gain the lich template.
	An integral part of becoming a lich is creating a phylactery, a magical receptacle containing your life force. When you are reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you and your possessions crumble to dust. Unless your phylactery is located and destroyed, your reappear in a space adjacent to the phylactery after 1d10 days.
	You must construct your phylactery before the ritual can be performed. The phylactery, which takes 10 days to create, usually takes the form of a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment on which magical phrases have been transcribed in your blood. The box measures 6 inches on a side and has 40 hit points and resist 20 to all damage. Other kinds of phylacteries include rings and amulets, which are just as durable.

You create the illusion of a single creature, of any size from Small to Large. It looks and smells like the creature in question. If the creature can speak or emit sounds, the illusion can do so as well, but on a limited basis (subject to the DM's judgment)—it's not possible, for instance, for the illusion to engage in an extended conversation.
	You can give the illusion simple instructions, such as having it wander a set area, appear to chew on local plants, and the like. Your Arcana check determines the number of actions you can instruct the illusion to take.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Actions
19 or lower	1 minor, 1 move
20–29	1 minor, 1 move, 1 standard
30–39	2 minor, 2 move, 1 standard
40 or higher	2 minor, 2 move, 2 standard&lt;/table&gt;

The illusion can perform these actions in a specific sequence, such as moving, taking a standard action, and then moving again, either in an endless loop or starting in response to a specific trigger, such as a door opening.
	You can also match each action to a specific trigger. An illusion might move when a creature moves next to it or cower and scream when it is attacked.
	Creatures that view or interact with the illusion are entitled to Insight checks to detect the fact that it is false. This check's DC equals your Arcana check result. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the illusion and each time it interacts with it. A creature that touches an illusion automatically determines that the image is a fake.

When you perform this ritual, choose a nonhostile Tiny natural beast, such as a cat, a fox, a fish, a mouse, or a sparrow. This animal must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, the animal regards you as a friend and performs simple tasks on your behalf. The tasks are limited to the options below, and assigning a task requires a standard action.
Fetch: The animal retrieves a Tiny object of 10 pounds or less that you and it can see. If the animal is unable to carry the object due to the item's size or weight, the animal enlists the aid of other creatures of its kind to fulfill the task.
Perform: The animal performs a simple trick, such as rolling over or playing dead.
Seek: The animal scouts ahead and examines an area for anything that's alive or animate. The animal can travel up to 20 squares away from you and uses your passive Perception check to determine if it notices hidden creatures in the area. When the animal returns, you learn from it whether a creature occupies the area. The animal cannot communicate any other information aside from the presence or absence of a creature.
Watch: The animal remains in its current location and watches that area. When you assign the animal the task, you designate creatures that are allowed to enter the location. If a creature that you have not designated enters the location, the watching animal informs you by coming to you and making a noise. If you move more than 20 squares away from the area, the animal leaves its post and rejoins you.
Unless otherwise commanded, the animal accompanies you for the ritual's duration, perching on your shoulder, hiding in your pocket, or walking alongside you. The animal has AC 14, Fortitude 12, Reflex 12, and Will 12. The animal has 1 hit point, and a missed attack never damages the animal.
Your Nature check determines the length of time the animal remains in your service, but you can release an animal from your service as a minor action.

At the heroic tier, you can have one animal at a time bound to your service using the ritual. At the paragon tier, you can have two animals bound using the ritual. At the epic tier, you can have three animals bound using the ritual. You must complete a separate ritual for each animal you bind.

You ward writings so others cannot read them. Use of this ritual protects one page (maximum 250 words). You make the page appear not to exist, causing anyone other than you to ignore it; the page's presence is blocked from a reader's mind. You can choose instead to obscure the page with false writings, which you produce before performing the ritual. Other readers see the false text rather than the real text.
	When you perform the ritual, make an Arcana check, with a +5 bonus. The result is the DC for a Perception check to notice the concealed writing (readers use passive Perception unless they are specifically looking for concealed text).

You create a passage through any solid material. You choose the orientation of the passage relative to the surface you touch. The passage is 1 square wide and tall. The passage can be a number of squares deep equal to your Arcana check result divided by 5. This ritual does not conceal the passage from anyone or bar anyone from entering. A creature inside the passage when it closes takes 5d10 damage and is ejected to the nearest end of the passage. This ritual does not affect the structural integrity of a cavern or a wall; the passage is a twist in space, not an actual shifting of material.

You inscribe a circle on the ground, a circle emblazoned with arcane symbols of protection. If drawn correctly, these symbols make it difficult for creatures of a particular origin to enter or pass. When performing the ritual, you choose aberrant, elemental, fey, immortal, natural, shadow, or all. The last option applies a –5 penalty to your check. The circle requires 1 minute to inscribe per square inside the circle (and it must be a circle).
	An affected creature whose level is lower than your Arcana check result minus 10 cannot pass through the circle, affect creatures through the circle's boundary, or affect the boundary in any way. Other creatures of an affected origin take force damage equal to your Arcana check result when passing through the boundary, but doing so breaks the circle.

As part of mastering this ritual, you must create or commission a chest that bears arcane designs, and an object with personal meaning for you must be built into the chest's frame. After the chest is ready, you can store it anywhere you like. Performing this ritual then summons the chest from wherever you left it to wherever you are, along with all its contents. You can remove or add objects to the chest (subject to its natural size limitations) when it is present. Any time after summoning it, you can dismiss it back to its previous location.
	Explorers use this ritual to ensure they have enough supplies or to cart treasure away from a dungeon more easily. If the chest is ever lost or destroyed, you must create a new one before you can perform this ritual again.
	Focus: A chest worth at least 200 gp.

You target a nonhostile Tiny animal, such as a sparrow, a raven, a fox, or a carp. The animal must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, you whisper a message of up to 25 words to the animal and name a recipient and a location. The animal bounds off toward the location, in search of the recipient. The animal avoids danger along its path. Upon finding the recipient, the animal approaches until it is adjacent to the recipient, and then your whisper issues from the animal's mouth, conveying the message. When the animal delivers its message or the ritual's duration ends, your influence ends and the animal reverts to its natural behavior.

You consult an entity of fate—perhaps a servant of Avandra, Ioun, Pelor, or the Raven Queen—for a glimpse into what the future holds. You ask questions, and a rumbling voice replies.

Your questions must relate to a specific goal, event, or activity that has yet to occur. Since what is yet to occur is not known by any mortal being, the answers need not be known by any creature, alive or dead. This ritual can answer only questions related to events occurring within the next 7 days. After that, the skein of possibilities is too indistinct to gain useful information.
	The guidance from the entity of fate is accurate, but great heroes are capable of thwarting fate, at least for a time. If the ritual reveals that a course of action is “certain doom,” you should realize that nothing is truly certain until it happens. In addition, the entity of fate assumes that you will act on its guidance completely and immediately. If you don't act on the information, or if you change the conditions in existence when you performed the ritual, then the guidance might no longer be useful.

When you perform this ritual, choose a specific object of up to Large size. You need not have held or viewed the object. However, when performing the ritual you must describe the object with sufficient clarity that the ritual unambiguously knows which object you're talking about. “Duke Karlerren's ancestral broadsword” is sufficient, as is “the nearest gold coin,” but “the most powerful magic item nearby” is not. This ritual can show you an object anywhere in the world, but it can't show you an object on another plane.
	The magic of the ritual interprets your statement of intended object in the most straightforward way possible. If your description is insufficient to determine a specific object, the ritual fails, and no components are expended. If your statement describes an object other than the one you intended—for example, if the nearest gold coin is in your pocket, rather than in the hidden treasure vault you're looking for—the ritual still functions, and the components are expended.
	You have no inherent way to discern where the object is in relation to you, but careful observation can give you some clues. If you see the duke's sword hanging on a stone wall, for example, you don't necessarily know whether that wall is across town or across the world.
	This ritual creates a scrying sensor—a shimmer in the air—adjacent to the viewed object that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way.
	You can hear through the sensor as well as see, and you have darkvision through it. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.

When you perform this ritual, choose a location you have previously visited. The location must be fixed in place (for example, you can't use this to scry into the cabin of an oceangoing vessel), and it must still be at the same place (and in more or less the same shape) as when you visited. Redecorating a room won't fool View Location scrying, but destroying a tower and rebuilding it with a different layout would cause the ritual to fail (until you visit the new location). You know if the ritual has failed before you expend any components. This ritual can show you a location anywhere in the world, but it can't show you a location on another plane.
	This ritual creates a scrying sensor—a shimmer in the air—that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way.
	You can hear through the sensor as well as see, and you have darkvision through it. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.
	Your Arcana check determines how long the sensor lasts.

Remove Affliction wipes away a single enduring effect afflicting the subject. The ritual can remove curses, effects such as charm or domination, and fear, confusion, insanity, polymorph, and petrification effects. All effects of the curse or other effect end.
	This ritual is physically taxing to the recipient; if used on an injured character, it can even kill him or her. Upon completing this ritual, make a Heal check, using the level of the effect you are trying to remove (or the level of the creature that caused the effect) as a penalty to this check. The result indicates the amount of damage the character takes. Assuming the character survives, this damage can be healed normally.

&lt;table&gt;Heal Check Result	Effect on Target
0 or lower	Death
1–9	Damage equal to the target's maximum hit points
10–19	Damage equal to one-half of the target's maximum hit points
20–29	Damage equal to one-quarter of the target's maximum hit points
30 or higher	No damage&lt;/table&gt;

	You can use this ritual on an unwilling subject (usually, a former ally who is under some enemy's influence), but you will have to restrain someone unwilling to undergo the ritual. If you know that your subject is suffering from multiple enduring effects, you must choose which one this ritual will remove. Otherwise, it affects whichever one affliction you knew about. You learn the affliction level when you begin the ritual, and you can choose not to continue, without expending any components (for example, if you determine the affliction is too powerful for you to remove).

To perform the Raise Dead ritual, you must have a part of the corpse of a creature that died no more than 30 days ago. You apply mystic salves, then pray to the gods to restore the dead creature's life. The subject returns to life as if he or she had taken an extended rest. The subject is freed of any temporary conditions suffered at death, but permanent conditions remain.
    The subject returns with a death penalty: –1 to all attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and ability checks. This death penalty fades after the subject reaches three milestones.
    You can't restore life to a creature that has been petrified or to a creature that died of old age.
    The subject's soul must be free and willing to return to life. Some magical effects trap the soul and thus prevent Raise Dead from working, and the gods can intervene to prevent a soul from journeying back to the realm of the living. In all cases, death is less inclined to return paragon and epic heroes; the component cost is 5,000 gp for paragon tier characters and 50,000 gp for epic tier characters.

This ritual conjures forth up to eight horselike creatures. Each one is Large and can be ridden by you or any other character you designate during the ritual.

Your Arcana check determines the speed of the steeds you conjure and whether they have any special movement capabilities. The steeds have the special movement capabilities associated with your check result and all lower results.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Speed	Special Movement
19 or lower	10	None

The steeds cannot attack or affect other creatures in any way other than to serve as mounts. Each steed's defense scores are equal to its rider's (or yours, if the steed has no rider). A phantom steed is immune to any effect other than damage.

A steed created by this ritual lasts for 12 hours or until it takes any damage. When the ritual ends, or when a steed is destroyed, the steed fades into nothingness and its rider lands on his or her feet in the steed's space. If a steed is flying when it disappears, the rider descends safely to the ground, landing at the start of his or her next turn.

When you perform this ritual, choose a specific creature. You create a magical sensor adjacent to that creature, and you can see and hear as if you were standing in the square where your sensor is located. You need not personally know or have ever seen the subject. However, when performing the ritual you must describe your intended subject with sufficient clarity that the ritual unambiguously knows which creature you're talking about. This ritual can show you a creature anywhere in the world, but it can't show you a creature on another plane.
	The magic of the ritual interprets your statement of intended subject in the most straightforward way possible. If your description is insufficient to determine a specific creature, the ritual fails and no components are expended. If your statement describes a subject other than the one you intended, the ritual still functions and the components are expended.
	You have no inherent way to discern where the sensor is in relation to you, but careful observation might give you some clues. The sensor moves with the subject for the duration of the effect.
	Your Arcana check determines how long the sensor lasts.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Duration

20–24	2 rounds

	You can hear through the sensor as well as see, and you have darkvision through it. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.
	Observe Creature creates a scrying sensor—a shimmer in the air—that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. If the target of this ritual notices your scrying sensor, the target can use a standard action to focus its will in an attempt to destroy the sensor. Make an opposed Wisdom check; if the target's result is higher than yours, the sensor is destroyed and you spend one healing surge but regain no hit points (or take damage equal to your healing surge value if you don't have any healing surges left). The subject can repeat this effort until the sensor is destroyed or the duration ends.
	Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block Observe Creature. If the subject's location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.

The Knock ritual allows you to open a single locked door, chest, gate, or other object. It even works against portals sealed with the Arcane Lock ritual or doors secured with bolts or bars that are on the far side, out of reach. You must defeat all the closures on a locked object to unlock it. You make one Arcana check per lock, bar, Arcane Lock, or similar closure. The object you unlock does not open automatically; you still must open it yourself after the ritual unlocks it.
	Make an Arcana check with a +5 bonus in place of a Thievery check to open each lock or closure. (See the Thievery skill description, page 189, for example DCs.) To undo bolts or bars you normally couldn't reach, you must succeed on a DC 20 Arcana check.

Through painstaking research and preparation, you prepare a valuable offering for a powerful extraplanar entity such as an angel, a demigod, a demon, or a devil. Your offering earns you an audience with the being, which appears as a ghostly image that cannot be attacked or physically interacted with. You must succeed on a skill challenge to obtain the information you desire from that entity. You gain a +1 bonus to skill checks made in the skill challenge for every 10 points of your Religion check result (+1 for a result of 10, +2 for a result of 20, +3 for a result of 30, and so on). This challenge might be against Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate, depending on the creature.

The entity begins in a neutral state—intrigued by the offering and willing to hear you out. But the entity has agendas of its own, and its nature might color the information and advice it provides.
	When you complete the ritual, you can designate up to eight other ritual participants who can also speak with the entity and contribute to the skill challenge. Each one gains the same bonus to skill checks that you do.

    <specific name="type"> Ritual </specific>
When you perform the ritual, ask up to three questions about possible courses of action. A translucent blue hand appears and indicates with a gesture what the most rewarding course of action is.
	If you describe courses of action that refer to directions or specific objects, then the hand points toward the choice that bears the greatest reward. If you ask the hand, “Should we head down the stairs or through the doors?” then the hand responds by pointing either to the stairs or the doors. If you ask the hand, “Which of these three levers should we pull first?” then the hand responds by pointing to a lever.
	If you describe only a single course of action, the ritual assumes that inaction is your other option. The hand either beckons you (to indicate that you should proceed) or gestures for you to halt. For example, the question “Should we explore the ruins of Solitronia?” results in the hand either beckoning you or gesturing for you to halt.
	The hand can't assess events in the far future; its judgment extends only to likely events in the next hour. If the hand can't indicate a preference, the ritual has no effect and expends no components.
	There are two drawbacks to using the ritual to aid your decisions. First, fate values rewards over risk, and this ritual provides guidance accordingly. It points you toward a high risk, high reward option before pointing you toward a low risk, low reward alternative. For example, if one tunnel leads to a dragon and great wealth and the other tunnel leads back to town, then the hand points toward the dragon. However, a high risk, low reward alternative is considered less rewarding than a low risk, low reward option.
	Second, the hand can choose only the most rewarding course of action relative to the alternatives provided. That doesn't mean that the indicated choice is necessarily a good idea, only that it's a better idea than the other options you've indicated. In the example above, if all three levers activate traps, then the hand points toward the lever that triggers a trap less lethal than the others.

This ritual works the same as Linked Portal, except as noted here. 
	You are not limited to teleporting to places you've seen or that have permanent teleportation circles. However, when performing the ritual, you must describe your intended destination clearly. “Lord Ambrose's audience chamber” is sufficient, as is “the nearest temple of Pelor.” Your description must use only place names and other static references; you can't say “wherever Princess Katria is” or “the nearest pile of gold.” The magic of the ritual interprets your intended destination in the most straightforward way possible. If your description is insufficient to determine a specific destination, the ritual fails, but no components are expended. If your description causes the portal to lead somewhere you did not intend—for example, if the nearest temple of Pelor is not in the city you'd hoped it would be—the ritual still functions, and the ritual's components are expended.
	If the destination is blocked by a warding ritual, such as Forbiddance, the ritual opens the destination portal at a point along the ward's boundary. You can see through the portal before you enter, and you don't have to step through if you don't want to.
	You can use a teleportation circle as the origin point of this ritual, making minor temporary modifications as part of the ritual. Using a teleportation circle reduces the ritual's component cost to 1,000 gp and grants a +5 bonus to your Arcana check.

The eyes do not hear, but they see well. Each uses your Perception modifier, with a +5 bonus.
	If an eye sees an intruder, it emits a loud warning sound defined by you during the ritual. This sound could be anything from a stentorian “Enemies approach!” to an owl's screech to a fanfare of trumpets. The Perception DC to hear the eye's sound is 0 (modified by distance as normal).
	The eyes never consider you an intruder. In addition, you can designate any number of other ritual participants as nonintruders. When you perform the ritual, you can also designate one or more categories of creatures that the eyes will ignore. You can define these categories by obvious physical characteristics (such as height, weight, or body shape), creature type (such as humanoid), creature race (such as hill giant), or obvious equipment (such as a creature carrying a shield with a flame emblazoned upon it).
	The ritual's effects last for 24 hours or until you move more than 20 squares from all the eyes.
	Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by using a focus of a small, jeweled eye made of silver and ruby, worth 100 gp. The ritual's effects last as long as the focus remains within 20 squares of any of the eyes. You can hide or protect the ritual's focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within 20 squares of the eyes.

You touch a normal item and turn it into a magic item of your level or lower. The ritual's component cost is equal to the price of the magic item you create. Alternatively, you can use the ritual to upgrade a common, uncommon, or rare item to a more powerful version of the item that is 5 levels higher. The new version must be your level or lower, and the component cost equals the difference in gold piece value between the old version and the new. You can also use this ritual to resize magic armor (for example, shrink a fire giant's magic armor to fit a halfling). There is no component cost for this use.

The Cure Disease ritual wipes away a single disease afflicting the subject, whether the disease is active or still incubating. The subject is completely cured and loses any negative side effects and symptoms of the disease.
	This ritual is physically taxing to the recipient; if used on an injured character, it can even kill him or her. Upon completing this ritual, make a Heal check, using the level of the disease as a penalty to this check. The result indicates the amount of damage the character takes. Assuming the character survives, this damage can be healed normally.

Heal Check
&lt;table&gt;Result	Effect on Target
0 or lower	Death
1–9	Damage equal to the target's maximum hit points
10–19	Damage equal to one-half of the target's maximum hit points
20–29	Damage equal to one-quarter of the target's maximum hit points
30 or higher	No damage&lt;/table&gt;

If you know that your subject is suffering from multiple diseases, you must choose which one this ritual will cure. Otherwise, the ritual affects whichever single disease you knew about. You learn the disease level when you begin the ritual, and at that point you can choose not to continue, without expending any components.

You coax forth an oracular spirit from the space between the planes. Oracles have no tangible presence and no agendas; they exist only to observe events. This makes them unparalleled sources of information because they have the potential to have seen and heard everything, even information otherwise known to only one creature.
	Make a Religion check to determine how many questions you can ask an oracle before it vanishes.

&lt;table&gt;Religion Check Result	Number of Questions
9 or lower	One
10–19	Two
20–29	Three
30–39	Four
40 or higher	Five&lt;/table&gt;

Each question is answered immediately, so you know the answer to one question before asking the next. You must phrase your question so that the oracle can answer it with a single word or a brief phrase. For the oracle to know the answer to a question, the answer must be known to at least one creature, even if that creature is no longer alive. The oracle has no foreknowledge and only a limited ability to judge what it sees. The oracle can tell you the order in which to activate the glyphs in front of the Gate of the Black Drake, but it can't answer the question “Will we do well if we venture through the gate?”
	Ten minutes after you finish performing the ritual, the oracle leaves, even if you have unasked questions remaining.

You ask a single question of mysterious, extraplanar presences about matters beyond your ken. Make a Religion check with a +10 bonus instead of an Arcana or a History check to uncover a clue, remember a bit of lore, or otherwise gain information about the world around you.
	The ritual grants you a single piece of information. That information can take the form of a word, a name, a phrase, or even a brief story, depending on what exactly you're looking for. You can learn the name of the usurper who ended the Katerran Dynasty a thousand years ago, the burial rites of the Crimson Wolf clan, or the weaknesses of the shadow assassins who have been dogging your steps.
	The ritual can't uncover information beyond the ken of the most learned sages. It's of no use if you're trying to find the magic word that unlocks the vampire's crypt, because only the vampire knows the word. Nor can the ritual tell you definitively where great stores of treasure are, but the mystic sages could tell you where a specific empress kept her treasury in ancient times or whether the treasure was looted when her empire fell.

When you perform a Wizard's Sight ritual, choose a square within 20 squares of you, even a square that you can't see or don't have line of effect to. You create a magical sensor in that square. You can see and hear as if you were standing there, and you have darkvision through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.
	Your Arcana check determines how long the sensor lasts.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Duration
19 or lower	1 round
20–24	2 rounds
25–29	3 rounds
30–39	4 rounds
40 or higher	5 rounds&lt;/table&gt;

The ritual creates a scrying sensor—a shimmer in the air—that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way.	
Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block Wizard's Sight. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.
	Focus: A mirror or a crystal ball worth at least 200 gp. The focus conveys what you see and hear.

You create a shortcut across the fabric of the world, linking your location with a permanent teleportation circle somewhere else on the same plane. With a step, you can move from one circle to the other. As part of performing the ritual, you must sketch out a 10-foot-diameter circle in various rare chalks and inks. This temporary teleportation circle must exactly match the permanent teleportation circle at your destination. It disappears at the end of the portal's duration.
	At the completion of this ritual, make an Arcana check. The result determines the duration that the portal remains open. 

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Portal Duration
19 or lower	1 round
20–39	3 rounds
40 or higher	5 rounds&lt;/table&gt;

	You can use a permanent teleportation circle as the origin point of this ritual, making minor temporary modifications as part of the ritual. Doing this reduces the cost to 50 gp of reagents and grants you a +5 bonus to your Arcana check.
	While the portal is open, any creature that enters the circle at the origin point instantly appears at the other location, along with anything the creature holds or carries. The creature can even finish the rest of its move. Any number of creatures of any size can use an open portal; the only limitation is the number that can reach the circle before it ends.
	Anyone standing in the vicinity of either end of the portal can see a haze-infused vision of the teleportation circle at the other end of the connection, as well as the environment 60 feet beyond it. Effectively, everything at the destination within this area of visibility is lightly obscured, and the area beyond is completely fogged out. (Naturally, portals that last longer give you a better opportunity to study the place you're going to before you step into the circle.) Environmental effects at one end of the connection don't affect the other end.
	Most major temples, important wizards' guilds, and large cities have permanent teleportation circles, each of which has a unique set of magic sigils etched or inlaid into the ground. The exact sequence of sigils matters, because you've got to match it if you want to open a portal leading there. The sigils aren't any more complex than remembering a string of letters and numbers. You can use Linked Portal to any permanent teleportation circle whose sequence of sigils you know. When you learn this ritual, your DM will tell you at least two such sequences. In your travels and research, you'll undoubtedly learn more.
	This ritual can take you anywhere in the world, but it can't take you to other planes. Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block a teleportation ritual. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.
