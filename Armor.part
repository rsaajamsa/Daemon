	  Plate armor is made from giant insect or crustacean chitin, or from the shells of creatures such as chathrangs or rare desert tortoises. Braxats and gaj provide the durable shells used to make mid-level masterwork plate armor. The rarest plate armor is derived from drakes and braxat lords. Armorers drill tiny ventilation holes in chitin-plate armor to make it bearable in all but the hottest weather.

Superior one-handed melee weapon
Cost: 10 gp
Damage: 1d6

Range: -
Weight: 7 lb.
This light shield is constructed with a sharpened spike at its center. A spiked shield can be enchanted as a magic shield or a magic weapon, but not both. A spiked shield enchanted as a magic weapon does not occupy a character's magic item arms slot. Although a character cannot use two shields at the same time, a character wielding a spiked shield enchanted as a weapon can employ arms slot items such as bracers.
Properties:
Off-Hand (An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can't attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.).

Light blade (Light blades reward accuracy as much as force. Pinpoint attacks, lunges, and agile defenses are the strong points of these weapons.). </specific>

Description: Barding is armor for your mount. It adds to a mount's Armor Class just as armor does to a character's. Barding also has similar check penalties and speed penalties. The barding's armor bonus is added to a creature's existing AC. Unlike heavy armor, heavy barding does not negate a mount's Dexterity or Intelligence bonus to AC. Creatures that fill the soldier role already have additional armor (natural or otherwise) factored into their AC. As such, barding is less effective for them.
